0,Have-you-ever-experienced-racism-from-a-liberal,2018-11-13 22:33:07,7069,1305,Any time I've heard: “Only white people can be racist.” “Enjoy your white privilege.” “Racism is in a white person's DNA. “ “Blacks have a right to loot and vandalize because of systemic inequities your people caused.” “You don't get to weigh in. You're a white male.” All of those statements are racist.
1,What-are-some-examples-of-institutional-racism-in-The-United-States,2017-11-29 20:23:33,31046,2150,"First, I want to check the dictionary to make sure I’m using “institutional racism” correctly: Ok. In that case, my answer fits the definition perfectly: The best public high schools in Chicago are called “selective enrollment” schools, because they do exactly that… selectively enroll students on a point system. Students are divided into four “tiers” based on the average income of the people on their block. The selective enrollment schools only take a certain number of students from each tier. Here is a map of the “tiers.” The green areas of the map are “tier 4” neighborhoods. The red areas are “tier 1” neighborhoods. Here are the scores needed to get into one of the best selective enrollment high schools in Chicago: A 900 is the best possible score. A student from a tier 4 neighborhood had to score 889 out of 900 to get into this school, but a student from a tier 1 neighborhood only had to score an 816 to get in. So that’s the “institutional” part. Now let’s look at the “racism” part. Here’s a map of Chicago demographics: If you were to overlay those two maps, you’d see an almost perfect correlation between CPS tier ranking and predominant race on the block. That’s an institution (Chicago Public Schools) using a metric to judge students that is de facto race-based. That is institutional racism. Before the tier system was established, it actually was completely based on race. But they got sued and changed it to “socio-economic status” which, in Chicago, aligns heavily with race. Yes, I know, the reason socio-economic status aligns with race in Chicago is because of generations of institutional racism in the past. The city is using this new institutional racism to try and correct the institutional racism of the past. I get it. I’m not even saying it’s wrong. I know why they do it. I’m just saying that it’s a textbook example of institutional racism: an organization that treats people from different races differently, and it’s considered normal and rarely questioned."
2,What-are-some-examples-of-systemic-racism,2020-06-27 05:50:52,20767,826,"Warning— This answer would be somewhat unconventional and uncomfortable. This   is, an often ignored example of Systemic racism. This bar-chart presents a demographics of gay men in USA. The discrepancy can  not  be ignored. There’s no biological theory that suggests black men are less likely to be gay. It is only natural that at least 10–12% of all gay men would be, ethnically black (given the fact US has 13% black population). But the statistics do  not  match that expectation. Why? The reason is purely social. Black men are less likely to come out. Black gay men are less likely to accept themselves. As a broader community, African-americans enjoy less exposure and less opportunities towards societal liberation and enlightenment. There’s a reason — why DL culture  is prevalent in the African-American communities. This ‘lack of liberation/enlightenment’ on a broader ‘community-level’, due to societal factors perpetuate into sexual practices and access to relevant healthcare. It imposes additional dangers to men of color. That is precisely why, despite being a statistical minority, African americans are significantly more affected by HIV. Statistically, black men are more than 10 times more likely  to be infected by HIV. Moral of the story — Systemic racism exists, and it hurts in more ways than we can imagine."

I’m not your noble savage; I am an individual with a sense of agency. My race is not deterministic of my behavior. There are white people I have power over. I could discriminate against them to favor blacks; I don’t. And it’s not because I’m incapable of being racist or feeling racial resentment. But, but , I hear you say,  racism only means systemic racism. And black people don’t have the power to enact systemic racism against others. So, however you define it, black people can exhibit racism."
4,Is-Indias-perception-of-the-caste-system-similar-to-Americas-perception-of-racism,2017-09-08 02:46:39,47067,2325,"In the US, racism is quite literally black and white. Those who have had a black ancestor is considered black and most others are white. Racism relies on the majority power there. In India, caste system is a continuum. Brahmins think they are superior to the Kshatriyas. The Kshatriyas rather than being offended are happy to be above the Vaishyas. And the Vaishyas have little issues with this as they are above the Shudras. And the Shudras have not complained as much either as they have dominated over a spectrum of “outcastes”. The more dominant of the outcastes discriminate the bottom part of the depressed castes. And the tribals are discriminated by outcastes. If it were a simple case of one caste dominating over the other, the thing would have been solved a long time ago. Unlike in the US, the upper most castes are very small minority and didn’t have much political power in the past. However, the spectrum allows almost every caste to have a dominant position in relation to some other caste. While they complain about the caste above, they are quite reluctant to release their hegemony over the caste below. A while ago a friend of mine was debating with me on the caste system. I argued that these hierarchies are meaningless. As he pushed on, I cited the example of Lord Krishna who was raised as a Shudra and was as holy as any other God. These caste divisions are crazy. For that he got offended saying that Krishna belonged to his caste [Yadav] and they were not Shudras and the one above them. And these are liberally mixed with economic classes, religious beliefs, ethnicities and language - the caste system is not standing alone but bolstered by several other systems. And a lot of the caste discrimination and chaos occurs in the middle. The Backward Castes [BC] of a slightly progressive state like Tamil Nadu, rather than fighting to remove the caste evils imposed on them often prey on the castes lower than them. Thus, the Vanniyars and Pallars fight in the north while Thevars and Parayars fight in the south -  Tamil Nadu’s caste fields: In 1 year, over 100 murders in two southern districts   . None of these castes are upper castes in an absolute sense, however in a spectrum of castes they are above someone. Somewhat similar happen in Maharashtra between the middle caste Marathas and the Mahars - a slightly well-off among the Scheduled Castes. In the US, it is quite clear to all blacks that racism and slavery is evil. However, in India most people of the depressed castes including many Dalits refuse to give up the caste system or fight it straight as they too have someone to dominate over. While they would want the shackles imposed by those higher to be removed they don’t want that to be at the cost of removing shackles they impose on those lower than them. Caste system and its discrimination are not easy to remove because most of us are in denial - we try to find quick scapegoats, but refuse to see that almost every community is intent on keeping the caste system for their own benefits."

For example, up until the 1960s it was perfectly legal, and common, for black people to be barred from buying houses in nice areas even if they could afford to live there, so they were corralled into poor areas which were then provided with poor schools. That has a long-term knock-on effect, because people who are 30 now have parents who went to those poor schools and lived in those poor areas, and many still *are* stuck in poor areas because they didn’t inherit a nice house from their parents - it takes a while for families and communities to catch up on that initial shortfall."

The only ingredient for racism is at least two people of different races and a hateful attitude by one. Any skin tone can be racist. Not having systemic power doesn’t excuse hateful acts to another race. You can be racist and have no power at all. The answer to your question is YES.

11,As-a-conservative-what-do-you-think-about-this-article-Dear-white-people-your-dictionary-definition-of-racism-is-wrong,2018-07-02 00:14:23,7544,744,"As a conservative what do you think about this article ""Dear white people your dictionary definition of racism is wrong?"" Dear White People, Your ""Dictionary Definition"" of Racism is Wrong   Well, if the title of the article itself didn’t tell me all I needed to know, this gem right here sealed the deal. Racism is not “systemic”. We actually have a phrase to describe systemic racism. It’s “systemic racism”. From  One would think that the definition of racism were simple. If we consult the Oxford English Dictionary, racism is defined as This seems pretty straightforward. If you believe one race is intrinsically superior or inferior to others, that is racism. If you believe that all members of a race share intrinsic characteristics, that is also racism. So the belief by the Nazis that the Aryan race was superior to all others is clearly racist. As is the belief that all Mexicans are lazy. Even the idea that all Asians are good at math is racist. This common definition of racism has been in use since 1902, when it replaced the earlier terms “racialism” [1]. This lexical definition is the one that most English speakers are familiar with, and the one that they use. Prejudice plus Power A new and pervasive mis-definition of racism in use today is that racism is prejudice  plus  power. This new  stipulative  definition was coined by Patricia Bidol in 1972 [2],  Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-media Social Studies Curriculum in Racism Awareness for the Secondary Level. This definition, which appears to have been a technical definition of use when discussing sociology in a specific, limited context, has escaped academia and is now used in some circles as the sole definition of racism. This has led to the ridiculous, and ironically racist, idea that only white people can be racist, but one cannot racist  against  white people. “Racism is prejudice plus power. On the basis of this definition, while all people can be prejudiced, only those who have power are really racist. African Americans, Latinos, Asians and American Indians, the powerless in American society, can be and often are most prejudiced toward Whites on an individual basis, but they are not racists at the structural, institutional level. Within this understanding of racism, to be a racist you have to possess two things: 1) socioeconomic power to force others to do what you desire even if they don't want to, and 2), the justification of this power abuse by an ideology of biological supremacy. Keep in mind that what often is described as racism in society today, is really nothing more than prejudice and discrimination. While a Black or Latino person, through the use of a gun and/or intimidation, can force a White person to do as he, as an individual, desires, this is an individual act of aggression, not a socially structured power arrangement. At present, however, only Whites have that kind of power, reinforced by a belief in an ideology of supremacy, both of which constitute the basis of racism in America today.” [3] By this strained and abused concept of racism, I’m left wondering, if I were to kidnap the Grand High Putz of the Klu Klux Klan, and drop him off in say, Kenya or China, would he still be racist? By the definition of prejudice plus power, no, he wouldn’t. For myself, I believe that he’d still be racist no matter where he is, due to his beliefs, not his power or lack thereof. Racism as prejudice plus power is a very narrow definition that is highly technical and applicable to a certain study of sociology. In that narrow context, the definition works, as a study of societies as a whole. However, the term is blatantly misused now to describe individuals. The problem here is the difference between theory in the scientific sense and theory in the general sense. Most people only know one definition, and don’t understand when it’s misused in a different context. Further, many of the very people who purport to be fighting racism are profoundly racist themselves against even people who are  not  white. The obsession with labels and cultural appropriation forces people into a very narrow path based on nothing more than their race and native culture. Frankly, in addition to be incredibly oppressive it shows a blinding ignorance of other cultures. References 1. Oxford English Dictionary 2.  https://books.google.co.uk/books...   3. The Undergirding Factor is POWER Toward an Understanding of Prejudice and Racism, By Caleb Rosado Department of Urban Studies Eastern University Philadelphia, PA,  http://www.edchange.org/multicul...   Furthermore, I have yet to read anything titled “Dear White People…” that isn’t itself racist. It’s a naked excuse for non-white folk to be racist bigots, but excuse their behavior as somehow not exactly what it is. The ironic part is, it is itself racist, no matter who it comes from. If it’s brown people making the claim, it’s racist and abusive gaslighting. “No, I’m not the racist, you are!”. From white people, it’s the soft bigotry of low-expectations. Evidently brown people aren't civilized enough to be held to the same standard as white people, and so get a free pass on being racist. Look, either you’re equal and held to the same standards as everyone, or you’re not."

When they asked for 200 National Guards to be brought in because they were afraid and unable to deal with a legal protest over their incompetence and racism, that was further incompetence. When they refused to investigate gun fire in the night or ask the guard to look into it, that was incompetence tinged with racism. When they were preferential to “militias” over the diverse National Guard, that was racism tinted with incompetence. When they treated black and white participants in the deadly event so differently, that was just plain racism. The Kenosha police cover the whole spectrum of gross incompetence (itself a side effect of white privilege in this case) and deadly, systemic racism, with special immunity. Extra points for a chief that goes straight to victim blaming. I bet next, their union will demand a raise."
13,What-are-your-thoughts-on-how-we-can-end-systematic-racism-in-the-US,2020-09-09 07:27:38,982,218,We need to abolish affirmative action. Affirmative action is an example of actual systemic racism. What are your thoughts on how we can end systematic racism in the US?

The US should abolish racism before it comes after the UK for the class system. Like the US race system, the UK class system has no organisation running, no laws that enforce it. In fact, like racism, there are laws against it, that don’t always work. The US has more of a class system than the UK. But it is based on a combination of race, religion and money, as opposed to the UK’s very weak ancestry based one. when a gay black atheist whose unmarried parents were share croppers has the same opportunity as a straight white member of a “good” church whose parents were Ivy League, I will admit that the US has no class system."
15,Is-the-USA-the-most-racist-country-in-the-world,2018-03-21 16:09:08,38202,2683,"As an immigrant, I’m going to say that the answer to this is a strong no. In the US, a large segment of the population is aware that racism is bad. Even people who hold racist opinions have a negative opinion of racism. This is why so many of them feel the need to preface their comments with “I’m not racist, but…” This kind of awareness that bigotry in the abstract, as opposed to bigotry directed against one’s own group, is a bad thing is really rare elsewhere in the world. The kind of prejudice that you encounter on a daily basis in many countries of the world has no sense of shame. People will be subjected to intense mockery for nothing more than having an accent. People will casually mention in polite society that immigrants from Haiti or Lebanon or Liberia or Ghana or Nigeria or Poland or Korea or India or Turkey or wherever else are ruining their host nation, and they’ll do so without batting an eye. Legally enforced discrimination will be placed on foreign national and their descendants without ever being questioned. If a person from an immigrant community commits a crime, there can easily be riots against all members of that community. In the US, it was possible for a Black man to be president! It wasn’t accepted by all the population, to be sure, but you’re not going to see that happen in France, Germany, Brazil, or Japan any time soon. The racism that exists in the US generally takes two forms: There are other forms of racism, of course, but these are the two that have an impact on a person’s socioeconomic prospects. I would say that, compared to what I have observed and read about elsewhere, American structural racism is relatively mild. And face-to-face racism is largely frowned upon. People can even lose their job for making a racist comment on air. You’re certainly not going to see that in very many other places. Of course, the election of Trump shows that large segments of the American public are not bothered by racism. But, as a non-White immigrant, I feel that I am treated much better here than I would be in most other places."
16,What-bothers-you-the-most-about-racism,2017-04-22 21:43:09,20365,1578,"(Please read all of this before you start with the hateful comments. I admit in it that racism exists, and that it’s wrong. I’m not denying that. Lots of things bother me about racism. But the question is: What bothers you the MOST about racism. So here it goes…) What bothers me the most about racism? That the political left in the US uses it to try and silence their opposition. It worked for awhile too, but then people started to see through it and now it’s not as effective as it used to be in getting people who disagree with you to “sit down and shut up”. Which is part of the reason why the left has found new insults to hurl at someone to silence them: “sexist”, “homophobe”, etc… And when they had a hard time finding actual racist individuals, the left began with their “institutional racism” spiel. It’s the perfect form of racism for their needs, because it implies that people are guilty of it just by being born into the system. A white person can’t do anything to prove that they aren’t racist anymore, because the entire “institutions” are racist. And that’s why so many whites have just given up trying to appear non-racist, particularly on the political right in this country. Just look at Trump’s cabinet. Mostly white guys. Why? Because the left is going to call him a racist no matter what he does, so why bother trying to appease them? Get who he thinks is the best person for the job, without any consideration for race or gender. Here’s a prediction: every person who runs for every position on the Republican ticket in the next election is going to be labelled as “racist”. Even if the person isn’t white. They will be called a “self-hating racist”. The word’s been thrown around so often that it’s lost its effectiveness. In the past, calling someone a racist might have gotten a response of: “No I’m not, and I can prove that I’m not!” Now, the most likely response is: “Whatever, Believe what you want about me. I don’t need to prove anything. I know the truth.” I’m not saying racism doesn’t exist. And I’m not saying it’s not wrong. It does exist. It is wrong. It’s also wrong to see racism EVERYWHERE, even when it’s not there, and to use it to your advantage. The truth is, politically, like many issues the left likes to champion (women’s rights, gay rights, etc…) they know that the worst thing that can happen for them is for those issues to actually get resolved. They NEED those issues to stay alive. They NEED people to think things are as bad now as they were in the 1950s for women and minorities. If people felt like everyone was treated equally, what would the left run on?"

18,What-is-the-difference-between-western-white-racism-and-Chinese-racism,2018-10-29 12:41:51,27136,999,"O…….k. As a an African-American who lived in China for 6 years, I think I am uniquely suited to answer this question. So, sit down and see yourself through the eyes of a real outsider. First, both have completely different origins and roots. In the Western world, what we define as racism was created by Northern European scholars in order to debase and dehumanize people who weren't white and weren’t Christian. It was a world view created to rationalize slavery and colonialism and help the participants to sleep at night, knowing that they were committing unspeakable atrocities. White racism is much more thought out, much more pervasive and is much older. White racism is “backed” by “sciences” like eugenics and evolution. It’s the belief that a people are inherently inferior because they aren’t white, Christian and “civilized.” Also, it’s based on inherent white-European supremacy and how they are supreme in every human way. It’s actually based on the linear progression of history from Barbarity to civilization and that Europeans are the height of human evolution. However, racism in the western world is seen as a historical atrocity and, it almost feels like, people nowadays are trying to work on it. Either, it feels to me, people are trying to eradicate it ( U.S) or are trying to convince themselves that they are so progressive and enlightened that they are beyond and above racism or the mention of race (Europe). In America, and this is important, racism is systemic, meaning that it has permeated policy, and has been ensconced in institutions that perpetuate the idea of black inferiority even though the members of the institution might not feel that way. Chinese racism isn’t even racism yet. It’s more like Xenophobia, mixed with Afrophobia, mixed with an inferiority complex that’s on top of a superiority complex. China clearly has a colorism issue and feels that because of its 5,000 years of civilization it should be “above” certain people and cultures. I once asked a Chinese coworker about this. She said “ we(Chinese) should be on top, we should be the leaders of the world.” She is one person, but what she says resonates with me, it resonates with what I hear from many Chinese people about how they feel about where China should be. I don’t know why, but there does seem to be a cultural supremacist tinge in Chinese culture. The average person, is like an American, they know very little about the outside world but make authoritative judgements based on scant information and poorly formed critical thinking skills. I don’t see it getting better, I see it only getting worse. During my 6 years in China, I saw a thriving African trade center get stripped down and the merchants moved out because of local worries about AIDS and disease. China test everyone who gets a visas to work there for AIDS/HIV but these locals were only concerned that in their minds “African” means “AIDS.” Chinese racism is in the nascent stage, it’s a disparate set of ingredients that are just now beginning to be mixed together in the proverbial soup. Compare Chinese attitudes about how the Uighurs in Xinjiang are all thieves or terrorists, how Africans are all lazy, and then compare that to what Europeans wrote about “savages” and “heathens” that they met in the Americas, then tell me what you think."

I saw answers that try to prove that the whole human civilization originated in India. The answers of these sort end up justifying caste system and tell you that Brahmans are the  real Aryans  of the world. The purest race. I saw commenters who commented how all the Indians have filth in their DNA and are “filthy Aryans mixed with Dravidians.” A few self proclaimed  genealogy experts  proved Kashmiris are Europeans and all the others in the subcontinent are dirty mixed race.

If we’re talking specifically about racism  against blacks  rather than all forms of racism, then it is undeniable that the lion’s share of  overt  racists are Republican (or at least more likely to vote GOP, regardless of  official  party affiliation). That is, there aren’t many Democratic Klansmen or any of the other sorts who would overtly and consciously speak against “n*gg*rs” or talk about how blacks need to “learn their place” or whatever. However, there are two forms of racism that are  vastly  more prevalent among Democrats and/or other progressives: And yes, I would argue that the latter two forms of racism are  worse  than whatever overt racism or implicit bias infects conservatism—because the latter two are  insidious : they make many blacks  collaborators  in their own discrimination. I do want to make one more effort at clarity, however, because of the highly charged nature of the subject matter: When I say, “X form of racism is [most common in / exclusive to] progressivism,” I  do not mean  that all or most progressives are guilty of it.

Otherwise it’s nothing more than the imposition of academic jargon on the rest of the population. For the vast majority of people on the planet, racism is race-based discrimination or bigotry. That’s it. Power is completely irrelevant. Otherwise, imagine this: Let’s say you’re a proud racist. You’re a card-carrying member of the KKK. You support white supremacy unabashedly. You live in a country where you are a member of the dominant race. Now, you decide to go on a safari to Tanzania. Your plane lands and, all of a sudden, you are in a place where your in-group lacks the preponderance of power. Does it mean that you’re no longer racist? Does this mean that you can take a vacation from being a racist, then go back to your country and be racist again? Is this really how this works? What about this? Many people in the US tell me some version of “Black people can’t be racist.” Okay. Let’s say you’re white, and you travel to Nigeria. Can black people in Nigeria also not be racist? They have the most wealth and power. And there are people around who will mistreat you for nothing more than the color of your skin. And if you got into an altercation, the police and justice system would likely favor them. You, the white visitor, might even find that there was systemic bias against you. So, are there at least some black racists in Nigeria? Yes or No? If not, how can that be? And if yes, what happens to these black racists when they travel to Sweden? Are they all of a sudden not racist anymore? This is obviously absurd. What likely happened is that some academic a few decades ago, for reasons that made sense within the context of their academic discipline, decided that a specialized definition of  racism  was needed. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, some people decided that the sociological jargon was the only valid meaning of the term. But it doesn’t actually make sense when you apply it to real-life situations."

He presents himself as the intellectual conservative whose logic and reasoning is deftly wielded to own the Libs. The issue is that many, many of the things he says are either cherry-picked, misrepresented, fallacious, straight-up wrong, or some combination of these. For example, in this clip, the original version of which has 206,000 views on YouTube and many hundreds of thousands more in the various “Ben Shapiro destroys leftists” YouTube compilations it’s included in, Ben asks a student who confronts him about institutional racism to, “name an institution that is racist.” Ben Shapiro Takes on Institutional Racism and White Privilege   The college student taking part in a Q&A that he is ‘debating’ here appeared to be unprepared for this response and couldn’t give much of an answer. Which, is exactly why he only debates unprepared college students in his audience. Ben Shapiro is a professional orator, he does this everyday, all day, as opposed to his debate opponents who usually don’t do this at all. In that context, of course it will always look like he’s the winner. But if instead of being a college student, this had been an expert, they would’ve been able to tell Ben Shapiro about the bias inherent to policing, the criminal justice system, healthcare, education, or more. Or they would’ve have been able to tell him how the institution at question when people talk about institutional racism  is racism. He only debates college students because he lies all the time and relies on his opponent not being as prepared as he is.

For beginners, Varna, a Sanskrit word with several meanings including type, order, colour, class or division of humans depending on the work they do, was used to refer to social classes. These and other Hindu texts classified the society in principle into four varnas: Now, I would ask you, why is there racism in our modern society? Why are White people considered superior to Black people by the society? Why can't we the society consider them equal? Yes, that is the problem here. In the Treta Yuga and Dwapar Yuga, there was no discrimination, no racism. Everyone was considered equal. The shudras though, we're considered inferior by some people and kings. Now, some people may tell that dividing people is not correct. But this type of division, i.e. the Varna system, is division based on work and what work should be carried out by whom. So, in the end, if discrimination and racism does not exist, then the Varna system is perfect and at the end of the day, All of us are humans. And also to know: “VARNA SYSTEM IS NOT CASTE SYSTEM”.

I played with kids of color, but sometimes my mom would call me to come home (not a cell phone, but a yell). I remember my dad stopping at the Gas Station and waiting for Odie, who was African American, to come out smiling to pump gas and look over the car. Mom would say, “ He's a nice colored man”. From a child's point of view I would look back and wonder what was so colorful? It was a long time before I even had a clue about systemic racism. Yes, I grew up in the midst of court mandated deseregation, and wondered why everyone was so mad. After all we got to go to school. Right? No, they were forced to come to my school. Systemic racism. In 1968 I watched the news and heard my parents talk about a great colored man being killed, and how he was different from someone named Malcolm X. I think mom wept. I know she did when Robert Kennedy was killed. Then there were the riots. Systemic racism was beginning to have bones. When I was 18 the KKK ask me and my friends to join up and save the country. But I had a friend who was black, and they wanted me to see him as less than human. Regretfully I considered before tearing up the application. Systemic racism had muscles and tendons . I watched the Olympics and saw some black athletes raise their gloved fists as they were given medals. I was kind of proud of them. Then my friend Donny, my dear black friend who put up with our Crap, drowned trying to save a white kid. Donny became my friend, not my black friend. Systemic racism has skin. I watched Barak Obama take the oath of office as President of the United States. Our first African American President. And I watched with amazement how he and his family carried themselves with rare dignity, such not seen amidst the scandals of Washington D.C. Systemic Racism had a voice. Now I'm a Pastor who has come to grips with the fact that the most segregated hour in our nation is during Sunday Worship. Systemic Racism is still within me, even though I despise it.

CHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY IMAGES When PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump about his plan to address racial inequality, the president pressed his fingers to his lips and said “shhh.” Pretty much every press conference Trump holds is an opportunity for him to show how classless, base, self-aggrandizing and out of touch with reality he is. He tells reporters to shut up, be quiet, they are “bad reporters” and they should be ashamed of themselves.  He calls them “fake news”. But to shh someone? Especially a black reporter asking about systemic racism in the middle of riots and protests? How fucking patronizing can he be? And he followed that up by declaring George Floyd is looking down from heaven and is “happy” to see job counts increase. I don’t think he could have said anything worse if he tried. Every press conference shows just how wrong it is to have this failed businessman as our President. He wouldn’t know how to lead a Sunday school class, let alone an entire nation. He’s not funny. His diction is horrible. He can’t read off a teleprompter. He has no charisma. Someone needs to tell him he can’t be on camera anymore. Shh. With finger to his lips. What an asshole.

I watched the entire response, not just the first part, so I’ll respond accordingly. To the specific question, yes, I am watching with horror and consternation. I’ve watched Donald Trump lean into the festering boil of US racism since 2015 with horror and consternation. After eight years of good governance and sanity with an eloquent, intelligent, competent and gracious black man as President, to have it overturned. I’ve watched as hate crimes have soared under Trump. I’ve watched as hate crimes spike in counties where he holds rallies. I’ve watched as white supremacists praise him. I’ve watched as Trump has enflamed racism and violence. I’ve watched as he’s encouraged the worst elements among the police to act in the worst ways. After the brutal deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, and the close call faced by Christian Cooper, I’m amazed at the forbearance of the vast majority of the protestors. The overt and systemic racism that black people continue to face in the USA is appalling. And Trump is exploiting it for his own narcissistic ends. Black people are suffering under Trump, as are Asians and Jewish people and others. He’s encouraging bigots to be violent, and then responding by attacking the protestors, a circle of violence that’s hard to comprehend. But Trudeau said a lot more than than the initial sentence. He turned his words and gaze to Canada and Canadians, and our failings. We live in a glass house. We aren’t perfect by any means. He pointed out clearly that black people and racialized people in Canada face systemic and often overt racism as well. And that we have to do better. We have to be allies. He used the challenging situation in the USA to challenge Canadians to be better ourselves. I’ve written about the   I was accidentally born with. I know how lucky I am, and I know the converse as well. The people born without all the marbles I had the good fortune to receive have to work a lot harder and smarter to get the opportunities that I have received. Trudeau’s response, formulated carefully and delivered eloquently, was the right one. He challenged me to do more. I’ll try."

I doubt anyone,  especially  folks who live in the American south, would call it true southern food. The way in which Cracker Barrel is quintessentially American south is a long history of entrenched racism. For years, Cracker Barrels had two dining rooms, one hidden behind a screen, and would seat non-white customers and white customers who looked weird in the screened dining room. (I and a group of friends stopped at Cracker Barrel on our way from DragonCon in Atlanta. We were wearing con clothes, and got seated in the undesirables room.) This practice was so pervasive—it was documented at scores of restaurants in seven states—that in 2001 Cracker Barrel settled a large-scale Federal lawsuit over systemic racism…and then in 2004 settled  another  Federal lawsuit over continuing systemic racism. In 2009 Cracker Barrel settled another Federal lawsuit saying that managers and other employees regularly groped, fondled, and harassed female employees. Then in 2017 it settled  another  Federal lawsuit, this one over violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. When I lived in Georgia, I and some of the folks I know regularly referred to Cracker Barrel as “Cracker Bigot.”"
37,What-are-African-Americans-tired-of-explaining,2018-11-12 09:31:10,12786,815,What are African-Americans tired of explaining?
38,Is-Brazil-racist,2017-11-04 12:09:11,74451,2058,"This is my personal take as an African American expat from the US who has been living in Brazil for about a decade: Yes, Brazil is racist - but in the main, it’s a different kind and flavor of racism than that of the US. Raw racism in the US usually has an angry and vicious quality, often tinged with flat out hate and pregnant with potential violence. Generally, you don’t see that kind of vicious racism in Brazil. Brazil got over its transition from slavery without going through decades of racial segregation, Jim Crow laws, race massacres, lynchings, political disenfranchisement, and all the other stuff associated with US racism that warped its social and political fabric, and whose pernicious legacy is felt to this day. Because Brazil lacked that legacy of widespread racist viciousness, I think Brazilians, including those of African descent, didn’t feel the same urgency to confront and challenge racism as happened and continues to happen in the US. Partly because Brazil’s is a more easy going culture, but also because the incentives were not as powerful: the impact of racism was immediate and far more oppressive, humiliating, and lethally dangerous, in the US, so it made sense that those in literal danger of getting killed by something would do more to tackle it than those whose stakes were not as high. Further contributing to that lack of urgency is that Brazil never had the “One Drop Rule” prevalent in America: there, an abhorrence by whites of racial mixing led to laws whereby those with even a tiny trace of African ancestry were deemed black, subject to all the racist oppression that went with that - I believe it was 1/32, meaning that if somebody was 1 part black to 31 parts white, he/she was considered black. So there was no “escape” from blackness in the US - at least not legally (although, of course, many light skinned blacks who could pass as white went ahead and did if they could get away with it). By contrast in Brazil, which never had that degree of abhorrence of miscegenation, mixed race people who in the US would have been considered and treated as black, frequently opt out of (or flat out run away from) that identity, with the result that Brazilians of African descent never coalesced and developed a common identity to the same extent that their peers in the US did. If US racial categories were applied in Brazil, it would be a majority black country. But the ranks of Brazilians of African descent are broken into a variety of categories, based on degrees of racial admixture, and a hierarchy based on lightness of skin and Caucasian features. Brazilian whites on the other hand are white, period. The end result can be seen in who controls and runs Brazil. In a country that is majority black by US standards, or at least majority mixed race by anybody else’s standard, this is what the government cabinet looks like - and this photo is from a progressive government, the previous one. The current government is even whiter (and more male): Which segues into the biggest manifestation of racism in Brazil: the very structure of the country and its institutions ensures that blacks are, and for the most part will remain, an economically impoverished class, with no viable fix in sight. Many in Brazil who don’t want to confront that try and explain it away by saying inequality in Brazil is based more on class than on race, but in reality, the overlap between class and race in Brazil is quite significant: rich neighborhoods are overwhelmingly inhabited by whites (whether US type whites or Brazilian “whites”), while the favelas or slums and poorer neighborhoods have a much darker hue. And the Brazilian system itself has a baked in mechanism that reinforces and perpetuates that inequality: the education system. Advancement in Brazil for most people is based on education and graduating from the elite public universities, whose admissions are based on testing. In of itself, that sounds good - a meritocracy where those who score highest in admission exams get admitted, so what can be wrong with that? Hiccup though is that the Brazilian public education system is generally crappy, severely underfunded and poorly run. There’s a parallel  private  school system however, that is far superior to the public one, but that is quite expensive, beyond the financial reach of most Brazilians. So you end up with two educational pipelines: a crappy but free public one, for the children of the poor and lower class (mostly black and mixed race), and an expensive good one for the children of the rich and upper middle class (overwhelmingly white). And the results of those pipelines are reflected in who scores high enough to get into those good/ elite universities that are the surest path to success and advancement in Brazil. Average kids from the overwhelmingly white upper classes whose parents could afford to send them to private schools can get into those universities, while only exceptionally smart kids from the overwhelmingly poor and (darker) lower classes can overcome the handicap of their crappy public school education to do the same. Essentially, you have a system that almost guarantees success if you’re born financially comfortable (which tracks closely with whiteness), while placing huge obstacles in your path if you’re not. And beyond that kind of structural racism, there’s also significant social and economic racism. Skipping the elites and just going into the workforce, even the blue collar uneducated work force, it’s quite visible just whom employers like to hire and present as their face to the public. Most jarring example for me was when I lived in Copacabana - a touristy and (relatively) upper class neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, where in all the restaurants on its main strip facing the beach, Avenida Atlantica, I did not see a single black waiter, for years on end. Busboys, janitors, and security, yes. But the faces with which the business interacts with the public? All white or “white”. Same in all the higher end stores, movie theaters, malls, etc. You hardly ever see black people in these jobs. Out in the back and doing the menial work, yes, but almost never at the front end interacting with customers. In jobs like street sweepers, electric company work crews, etc, where most of the workforce is black, the supervisor or boss most often is white or “white”. Even in classifieds/ “help wanted” job advertisements, there are frequently qualifications about “appearance” or “presentable” that are commonly understood as meaning that blacks or people with clearly African features need not apply. And on Brazilian TV and movies? In a country that is majority black or mixed race, black soap opera (Brazil’s biggest entertainment thing) or movie stars are quite rare, and to the best of my knowledge (although I don’t watch Brazilian TV that much so could be mistaken), there is not a single black major news anchor, major reporter, or night show host. So yes, Brazil does have its share of racism. As noted, not the same type of racism as in the US, but one with its own organic flavor. And in some ways, worse than in the US, where it is at least often challenged and confronted head on. In Brazil by contrast, racism and its impact are allowed to just mosey on by, with a significant chunk of the population, including many of its victims, pretending that it does not exist, and so giving it a far longer lease on life than it otherwise would have."

Your race, for you, is about as consequential as the fact that you have two elbows. It’s just something you can take for granted. You’re not going to have run-ins with the criminal justice system because you look suspicious to a police officer. You will be aware of your race, because you will have learned about colonization, and because most of the movies you watch will have White actors, but day-to-day, your race won’t be meaningful to you. Imagine that you move to a country where blacks constitute a minority of the population. Initially, you might still not want to think about race. You will keep your own mindset and decide that race is about complexion and nothing more. But soon, you will notice a couple of things: The result of this will be that even if you don’t start out that way, you will end up with a very acute sense of your blackness. Talking about racism is a very thankless task. This is why my forays into discussions about race are few and far between.

Fact of the matter is, the only thing similar between the Hitlerite racism and the more ‘old-fashioned’ racism of the Americas and to a lesser degree, parts of Western Europe, was… that they were both racism and that both were largely nonsensical. Beyond that, they could hardly be any more different. In the United States, the root of the KKK-esque racism was an obsession with blood, a nonsensical belief in the purity of race and the inherent superiority of the white over the colored. In the book of the KKK, the white was  always  superior, and the black  always  inferior. Under the National Socialist rule things were different. While the notion of ethnic superiority, a vital component of racism, was still present, it carried a strong cultural edge: in the Third Reich, the obsession with cultural purity perhaps overcame the racial obsession. This was the root behind the Reich’s widespread Germanization policies, targeting ‘suitable candidates’ from all over Europe to over generations be made into Germans, entire nations subsumed into the Reich’s future ‘Germans’. Post box in Posen, occupied Poland. Overwhelming use of German language instead of the local languages was a major factor of Germanization policies in some occupied territories. In the contemporary racism of United States, anyone holding KKK-esque beliefs would find it absolutely  preposterous  that a black, or even someone with partial black ancestry, could  ever  be the racial equivalent of a white person no matter what culture he adopted or grew in. In the Third Reich, this was completely normal: what made you ‘suitable for Germanization’ was a far broader racial category than what made a man Aryan. The  Volksliste  in occupied Poland, Heydrich’s war against the Czech culture in Bohemia, all of those had one ultimate goal: cultural assimilation of racially suitable groups. In the Reich, the racial lines were far less stern and far more porous. Another vital distinction between the two systems was  who  was superior and who was inferior. In the United States it was a simple, almost visual difference: the whites came on top, with some exceptions(No Irish Need Apply, for an example), and all manner of people of color were at the bottom. In Germany, the question’s answers were rooted in twisted philosophy and deep, pseudoscientific theories on which much thought was expended. There was little focus on something as rudimentary as skin color: pale-skinned Jews could and did find themselves target of an engine of extermination while the thousands of Afro-Germans never faced systemic persecution. It was far better to be a Jew in the US rather than in the Reich, while a black in Germany was guaranteed to face markedly less discrimination than one in the US. Many people loathed as inferior in the US were among the top of the racial strata according to Germany, and vice versa. The only blacks in Germany to ever face significant discrimination was a small group of approximately four hundred, the so-called Rhineland Bastards, and they were targeted not just because they were blacks but because they were children of Allied occupation soldiers: their existence was considered insulting, their mothers traitors, and they were forcibly sterilized(but not subjected to the Holocaust). The National Socialists and the KKK both hated someone for racial reasons… but they hated different people, and they defined the objects of their hate in drastically differing methodology. Thus, it was inevitable that unlike the common conception, they were really not fans of each other. Two men in the robes of the KKK walk in the streets of Reich-occupied streets of the United States, as portrayed in Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. The portrayal as KKK as an ally of the National Socialists is an interesting example of common misconceptions. As much as people like to lump together these two groups, they were not, and never worked together.  Ausland-SD , the SS foreign intelligence branch which had fingers in a dozen pies in the United States, never even bothered to contact the KKK, which they regarded with veiled disdain. The imagery of the Klansman with his hood up, and the notorious ‘human zoos’, were an ubiquitous part of anti-American wartime propaganda: As a final word, unlike what one answer here claimed, I have my doubts that the Americans sharing the KKK’s opinion of racial relations had any qualms with Germany’s ‘mistreatment’ of American black athletes, especially since such a thing never took place. If they indeed were taking umbrage with the  Reich  of all places and not with their own country for ill treatment of black Americans, they were either imbeciles or were being astoundingly and willfully blind about it. Hitler saluted Jesse Owens publicly, and shook his hand in private, while in the United States the man was made to enter his own hotel from the service entry, and was not even decided worthy of getting a telegram from Roosevelt. Being a black in Germany in the thirties was decidedly superior an alternative to being in the United States, as Owens himself agreed. At least in Germany, a black could sit wherever he wished on a bus, and eat at whatever restaurant he damn well pleased. If any American was taking umbrage at Germany for ‘ill treatment of American black athletes’, I dare postulate they were suffering from a severe case of the pot and kettle syndrome."

Systemic racism effects you regardless of how you feel about it or whether or not you acknowledge it. Ignoring racism is like ignoring a virus. It doesn't care how you feel about it. The best you can do is get used to it and eventually learn how to navigate in a world that has hostilities toward you.
45,Is-it-more-safe-to-live-in-the-UK-as-a-Black-person-compared-to-the-US,2020-06-06 09:56:51,39310,1029,"To be honest, astronomically safer. I can only speak from experience, but as a black person of Caribbean descent, I have received more racism/discrimination from minorities, than I have from white people in this nation. See, I used to live in an area of East London which was predominantly minority ethnic, and was filled with non-black minority teenagers using the n word, saying I looked ""disgusting"" or ""like a girl"" for having cairnrows, saying I acted ""white"" or ""posh"" for speaking in RP, not to mention that homophobia (which is obviously irrelevant at this stage). As soon as I moved to a predominantly white area, my neighbours were nicer, my family and I were invited in by a nice elderly woman for tea, and people smile and wave all the time. I even nod to patrolling police officers when I'm on my way to the corner shop (convenience store if you're an American). Perhaps it's the area I live in, or perhaps it's the way I dress, either way, it's safer for me. This doesn't mean there isn't racism in the UK however, but I'll get to that soon. If we look at the statistics, we can see that in comparison to the rest of Europe, and the world, Britain is one of the least racist. This Harvard-based ""implicit association test"", shows the levels of racial implicit bias in each country. The lower the score, the better. You can see that the United Kingdom possesses one of the lowest scores, particularly in contrast with Eastern Europe. If you wish to look at the states, here you go: Obviously, conclusive statements like the one I'm about to make require plenty of evidence. But, you can see that some states such as Mississippi and South Caroline, are even more implicitly racist than Eastern Europe, according to these maps. Only Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico reach the United Kingdom's level. There are far more statistics online, which I leave to you to research. Britain also has a better (although still abhorrent) history with black people. Slavery was abolished almost 60 years before the States, and in 1834, 40% of government expenditure was used to free all 750,000 slaves in the West Indies - a total of £32bn today. White people in Britain campaigned against the inhumane justice that Africans at the time and their descendents went through, and although there's (much) more to the story, there wasn't years of segregation, or institutional racism, and West Indian people were welcomed in post-WWII, but Theresa May's government recently had the Windrush scandal - oopsies. Anyhow, the question isn't ""which country is more racist"" the question is about the safety of blacks in the U.K. compared to the U.S. You should always get a second opinion, part of the reason why Quora is so fantastic, but I would say the U.K. fares better. Black people however, are still killed more often by the police (not on the scale in the U.S.), subject to more racial bias in the workplace and in society and more likely to be stopped and search (although a lot of this is to do with the fact black people tend to live in high-crime areas). In fact, a lot of the reason why black people don't get shot as often as in the States is to do with the fact that the police aren't militarised, trained killers, nor do they carry guns, although that has recently changed after terror attacks of the last decade. There are still socioeconomic factors to consider as well, regarding why black people tend to commit more crime. On the whole however, I must say that the U.K. is a safer place for black people to live, work and stay. If someone passes you in the street in London, they won't say anything because Londoners are mean, in a village, or town, they may well say hi. There is also more ""afriphobia"" (not liking African people) I feel, and because Brits are so polite, regardless of our race, racist Brits will keep everything behind close doors. I have been mistaken for a white person due to my name, and on the phone due to my voice, and have heard racist remarks/""jokes"" as a result. Systemic racism is also a huge problem.

In India’s own case, Kerala is highly educated with high HDI numbers, but still caste system is extremely strong there. A rich person may not be less casteist than a poor person. An educated person may not be less biased than an uneducated person. Just that rich, educated people have better cover for their biases and have better communication skills. In fact, many rich, educated people find comfort in casteism. Caste becomes an easy way for them to understand why they are successful while others are not. They might find comfort in the networks provided by castes. And they might find comfort in the identity provided by the castes. Our generation is undoubtedly richer than our previous generations. But, we are not necessarily less casteist. Just that many of us grow to not fully express or visualize the caste system as we grow up. Gujarat can be both developed and casteist.

47,What-is-the-most-extreme-political-hypocrisy,2020-10-07 16:17:38,28652,852,"For several years, I’ve taken unpopular stances in defending institutions of the United States that come under heavy criticism. These included defense of the   and more recently, defending the very institution of the police. In both cases, whether it’s about kneeling during the anthem or claiming that the police are racist, the issue we deal with is  “systemic racism.” “Systemic racism” isn't racism, as most of us understand it. It isn't when a person is treated differently because of their skin color. That’s the definition we all used to believe. Racism is said to be ""systemic"" when the negative treatment doesn’t come from an individual, but from the system itself. Think Jim Crow. Jim Crow was systemic racism because treating people differently because of race was literally written into the laws. The systems that existed were clearly and demonstrably systemic racism by design. With systemic racism, you could have institutions filled with otherwise decent people, but because the rules are written in, it will do things that oppress or hold back certain people automatically. For example, Civil Rights was about fighting systemic racism, as in, if there is a rule on the books that is literally written to treat one race different from another, that’s illegal. Once discovered, anyone could challenge it in a court of law and that rule will no longer be a rule. This was the purpose of Civil Rights. It provided the legal framework for fighting systemic racism, as in, if there is a rule on the books that is literally written to treat one race different from another, that’s illegal. You can challenge it a court of law and that rule will no longer be a rule. That was the victory of the Civil Rights movement. It wasn’t that we “fixed racism”. Such high minded ideals will never happen. So long as people themselves are different, someone will come to generalizations and not like them. I prefer that reality to one where we’re all soulless robots. But Civil Rights did create a system whereby people can challenge unfair laws or organizational polices in courts and those organizations could be pressed to change. The organization continues to provide service to the community, but the rule that hurts people is removed. Whatever racism existed in the system is purged and racism itself is disincentivized throughout society. Win-Win, but it takes time. Not days or weeks, but at least a generation. You were born in a time where racism is considered very ugly. 99% of humanity going back tens of thousands of years... thought it was a survival tactic, and it worked. Be thankful for the times you live in, but radical change following every ideological whim will undermine whatever healthy progress we've thus far created. This process, beginning with abolition, continuing through the Civil Right's era, has already been going on now for several succeeding generations. The incentives to be racist, either personally or instructionally are so bad that trying it openly will cost you. In that sort of culture, racism dies. Yea. That’s why racism is the lowest it’s ever been… well, that’s not true. Things were better around 2009, but that's another story for a different day. But in general, the great crime of our education and information dissemination systems is the failure of the average American to know that we are the least racist today than we have ever been, or even that America, when measured against almost anywhere else, is one of the least racist places in the world. That is to say that while finding individual examples of racism isn’t very hard, it’s hard to say that all Americas are racist. Finding an example of a neo-nazi or member of the KKK isn't hard. I mean, it's very hard to find one in person, but the media is very good at making sure you see the few who come out. Did you know that the KKK only consists of about 7,000 members, and that they are mostly just small feuding groups spread across the country with no influence at all? That's not a conservative stance. That's actually sourced from the Southern Poverty Law Center's hate group tracker, and the SPLC has anything but a history of being fair in that regard. That they could only prove about 7,000 disparate people should say something about how much attention they receive. But this is also racism, of the kind that you very rarely see outside of a few select sources. Finding examples of racism that goes the other way isn't difficult either. Seeing things like ""Die Whites Die"", ""All White People are Racist"", undermines the notion that racism is a purely white problem. To say nothing of events that should outrage everyone, like the kidnapping and torture of a mentally handicapped man, tied, beaten, and forced to drink from a toilet while denouncing Donald Trump by four black kidnappers. They’re bigotry was so normalized that they broadcast it over Facebook. How normal do you have to think a hate crime is to post it live to Social Media, not realizing this will probably have consequences? Why we aren’t talking about this daily still boggles my mind. ( Four charged with hate crimes for torturing mentally disabled teen on Facebook Live   ) Regardless of these events, or the existence of groups who are hateful, that doesn't define a population of over three hundred million people. We've been told for decades against the evils of overgeneralizing whole populations. Why does that rule apply to some groups, and not to America itself? Measuring objectively, it’s very difficult to prove that racism is actually a defining characteristic of our country. In fact, the more you look elsewhere (save for those special utopian European cities where all the tourists go) you see that America is far more racially tolerant than is normal. That is to say that the presence of racism somewhere in a population does not make the population racist, just like a person of a particular color being in a gang doesn’t make everyone who looks like him gang members. I assume I don’t need to illustrate this point further. But that’s exactly what we’ve done. For reasons that are too extensive for this letter, we’ve taken examples of some people’s racism, mostly a small handful of white supremacists spread across the country in tiny pockets of discontentment, added the fact that racial economic and social disparity still exists, and ignored all other possible explanations for why that could happen, and jumped to the conclusion that white supremacy built and perpetuates a system specifically designed to disenfranchise people of color. What other explanations exist? I’ve written a massive answer on answering just that question:   There, you’ll see many arguments for why there is racial disparity in America that are not caused by racism. And the people I sourced for that aren’t other white people. They are black conservatives who look to more grounded explanations for why things are as they are in their communities than the simple excuse that the racism of someone who doesn’t live anywhere near them, has no power over them, and has no interest in their lives, is still responsible for most of the disparity in 2020. That’s a massive answer, so if you’re curious, go there, but we’re not going to talk about it, here. What we are going to talk about is how, in spite of many, many well documented examples demonstrating why black disparity exists that have nothing to do with racism, it is believed that whole vital institutions in America are said to be systemically racist. For example, let’s start the police. Currently, we’re just coming down from a months long struggle that culminated with violence towards police and calls for abolishing them everywhere. Why? Because the police, not just some police officers, but the entire institution of policing in the United States is said to be racist at its core. The police, and the justice system itself, are considered to be systemically racist because more blacks are imprisoned than whites per capita. Individual high profile incidents shine a bright blazing beacon on the problem, and point to a system that makes cops actually racist, specifically targeting blacks for arrest, and even killing, some going so far as to accuse the American police forces as literally guilty of black genocide. Those aren’t true. There have been numerous studies done that show that blacks and whites, when in the same situations are treated the same by cops, such as police shootings. In fact, studies have shown that white police officers are less likely to kill minorities than other whites in similar situations.  No, the issue is that there are more crimes committed per capita, and particularly violent crimes among those populations than others. That is the disparity, and the criminal justice system should reflect it. Solving for  why  that happens is something I already addressed  . Simply put, bad policy, which people voted for, that led to destructive unintended consequences on a population like increasing fatherlessness in the home, the decline of education standards, shipping jobs overseas, or piling tens of thousands of people in a few block area (the Projects) was a recipe for the predictable disaster that has fallen on black cities. And it was predicted. People said that we would see a rise in crime and other vices and we did. It's not an aspect of black culture. That is not a natural consequence of a people that gave us Frederick Douglass, the Harlem Renaissance, and Thomas Sowell. It's a consequence of bad policy, and of politicians who refuse to take responsibility for saying, ""Our ideas may have meant well, but failed and now we have do the hard thing, and take away programs that people have grown dependent upon. It will cost us votes, but it's the right thing to do."" Rather than do that hard thing, those same people blame other people's racism, and the cops. Because there is a demonstrable difference in the outcomes one race experiences, regardless of the initiating events that led to that difference, it is said that there is inequality and when race is involved in that, it is racism. Too often, actually reviewing the specifics of a case undermines the argument that a specific person’s white racism was to blame, in the first place. People rioted and destroyed whole cities because of that belief, but the facts don't add up. A thorough look into the history Michael Brown, famous for ""Hands up; Don't shoot"" is a case study in how an incident can be turned 180 degrees from what actually happened to what people were protesting about. Whatever, the case, that and all the other incidents are still viewed as proof of America's white racism and of the police. The racism is built into the system, regardless of the individual cop in question. Where no individual’s explicit racism can be proven, but some racial inequality exists… then the cause is systemic racism. Put differently, the arguments of systemic racism say that whether or not racism exists in individuals, it exists at the organizational level. This is particularly true if those organizations and institutions were built during more racist times, having inherited the racism of their founders, who subtly built the racism into the system. It really doesn’t matter what events have transpired since then, what reforms have been made, even cases where racist people were purged, or racist policies stricken either by an act of law, or by the institution itself voluntarily. The extremist view that is gaining significant wind is that an organization that in any way held a different standard of ethics than we do today, be that racism, sexism, or otherwise, is irredeemable and must atone or be abolished for past crimes. If the institution existed during a time more racist than today, they are part of whatever problems exist for racial minorities at present and therefore… racist. Worse still, any greater institution, such as the United States itself, which doesn’t  solve  the problem as the accusers see fit (not being “anti-racist”) then they are racist as well. This was why Collin Kaepernick’s is now famous, as demonstrated in own statements when he refused to stand for the flag of a racist nation. To quote him: ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" Here’s an interesting case to to consider. In 2002, there was a lawsuit which held eight American companies responsible for reparations for blacks in America because of links to slavery over 150 years prior… to the tune of  $1.4 trillion dollars . A prayer on a Brooklyn street preceded the filing of an unprecedented $1.4 trillion lawsuit against eight major corporations alleged to have profited from their historical ties to the slave trade more than 137 years ago. Claiming to represent all of the United States' 35 million African-Americans, New York slave reparations activist Deadria Farmer-Paellmann named Aetna Inc., CSX Corp. and FleetBoston Financial Corp., among others, as unjustly profiting from the slave trade before the Civil War ended in 1865. ""We are going to finally hold corporations accountable for the crimes against humanity that they've committed against my ancestors,"" Farmer-Paellmann told reporters Tuesday. (Eric Shawn, 2002) Later in the article, more light is given on the fact that the law firm Farmer-Paellmann was the same firm who won over $8 Billion from Swiss banks who held Nazi assets taken from Jews before and during World War II. They base the legitimacy of their 2002 claims on the fact that companies like Aetna had already previously acknowledged that shortly after its founding it insured the lives of slaves in a 2000 acknowledgment expressing their deep regret over any participation at all in this deplorable practice. Likewise, CSX was placed on the list because slave labor was produced to build railways. Beyond that, companies such as New York Life, AIG, J.P. Morgan Chase, Wachovia, and FleetBoston also made the list. Wachovia, it needs to be highlighted, didn’t even exist during slavery. It was founded in 1879. They were held responsible for the actions of two companies they purchased in 1991, the Bank of Charleston and Georgia Railroad and Banking Companies, both of whom owned slaves prior to the Civil War. Yet the burden was pushed to Wachovia, somehow. That’s interesting, because now Wachovia itself no longer exists. Following the collapse of the banking industry in 2008, Wachovia was purchased by Wells Fargo. That said, the argument that Wachovia had any wealth it owed to slavery following 2008, or the numerous other recessions it survived, to say nothing of the Great Depression which preceded it, is a tough sell, particularly when its sin came from two other companies it bought years prior. But give it about 10 more years, and we’ll see if anyone starts looking to Wells Fargo for their slave owning past, by way of the defunct Wachovia, by way of two companies which stopped existing in the 1990s. This is to say that at no point will the apologies or the forms of reparations be enough, so long as someone somewhere has not achieved prosperity and someone somewhere can be linked to some ancestral form of victimhood.  This case ended with the expected failure, however numerous companies were forced into some action. J.P. Morgan Chase apologizing for some tie to slavery and the creation of a $5 million scholarship program in 2005. But it didn’t stop with just that case. So that we understand the situation, eight companies were forced in 2002 to defend the notion that they are currently responsible to pay for their participation, or rather, their existence in the vaguest of definitions, in normal market activities of the time, from a 150 years prior… for 1.4 trillion dollars. A rational thinking person would argue that a company which traded slaves prior to the Civil War is doubtfully still profiting from that individual choice. Given the undeniable destruction of the South’s economy from the Civil War, a Great Depression, and numerous recessions since, it’s hard to say that slavery is why these companies remain successful and why they hold some burden of guilt. They don’t. It’s not reasonable. While this case sounded ridiculous, this “original sin” outlook of judging and punishing today’s institutions based on the events of hundreds of years ago is a modern basis for critical race theory. Collin Kaerpernick’s now famous kneeling has awarded him millions based on this idea, but  #takeaknee    wasn’t even the worst case of original sin critical race theory in action. For that, we should look to the New York Times’ 1619 Project. Immediately after the Trump/Russia collusion story fell through, the New York Times’ very intentionally shifted to a narrative of America’s troubling racist past and it’s implications in today’s world.  1619 Project’s stated aim is to “reframe the country’s history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of [the United States'] national narrative."" What it actually does is attempt to paint the America which exists today as being truly founded in 1619 with the first slave trade in what would become the United States, and that America’s legacy, its very essence, is one built on the backs of slaves. The Civil War, the repeal of Jim Crowe, Civil Rights reforms, none of that matters because in the beginning, slavery existed and for all time, that fact will remain… so long as the United States itself does. The 1619 Project has also been widely criticized for a very revisionist interpretation of history, stretching truths to paint the United States, the Revolution, the Civil War, and even Abraham Lincoln through a very cynical lens. Sean Wilentz, an expert on early American History for Princeton University rebuked the 1619 Project for “rendering [Abraham Lincoln] as a white supremacist”.  In a post to  The Atlantic  he also said that ""No effort to educate the public in order to advance social justice can afford to dispense with a respect for basic facts"". Other criticisms came after accusations that the American Revolution was really fought to protect slavery and other for the intended attacks on capitalism, as 1619 was “construing slavery as a capitalist venture despite documented anti-capitalist sentiment among many Southern slaveholders.”  The 1619 Project’s failures make it clear what it was about. It wanted to paint the United States as a nation defined by racism and slavery by reinterpreting its roots. Looking to the timing and stated goals of the editors discovered through leaks, it was also clear that this more about short term political victories (which as news paper shouldn’t be in the business of pursuing anyway). Regardless, this theory of original sin guilt of the past, only makes sense if you follow the central premise that just because a flaw existed in the beginning, that it will therefore be a problem for all time. I don’t. The creators of the 1619 Project aren’t alone. Critical Race Theory perpetuates the notion, arguing that the Anthem of the United States needs to be removed because of an out of context mention of slaves in an all but forgotten second verse. Because it has been branded historically racist, that paints any occurrence of the anthem as “deeply problematic”. Moving on, others have said that the Constitution itself codifies Systemic Racism because it was written by white slave owners. Done. Follow on amendments such as ending slavery and guaranteeing legal rights to all people regardless of skin color simply do not matter. The only context which does matter was the context upon which the foundational document of the United States was written. Many of those men owned slaves, so anything they wrote was white supremacy, and therefore, we live in a racist nation… even if no one can clearly point to the racist people in positions of power, what specifically they have done that was racist, what policies explicitly or implicitly create racist inequality, or which specific parts of which institutions are creating racist outcomes. America was, is, and will always be racist. That’s it. Okay, now that we’ve laid out what systemic racism is, who it affects, and how it is an inescapable and unforgivable burden of guilt on the accused… we need to talk about the hypocrisy. If racism was ever part of the picture in the history of an organization, then it is forever marked by that fact. It can never be anything but an oppressive organization. That's the new rule. We’ve seen that a civil war that was the deadliest in our nation’s history wasn’t enough to pay for the guilt of American slavery. Numerous amendments to the Constitution aren’t either. Civil Rights reforms making laws targeting others didn’t do the job. Now, proving racism is harder than ever before, where we don’t even know what exactly needs to be stricken to somehow make it better. We’re at a point that the sources of racism are so vague that we have to simply look to organizations that existed during times when things were worse than they are today as responsible. It was there at their foundation, so its there for all time. Right? So, where does the hypocrisy come in? Because the people who say these things the most, are Democrats trying to elect Joe Biden as President of the United States. Let’s keep this idea of systemic racism, original sin guilt of America as demonstrated by the 1619 Project, and all the other examples I’ve pointed out, and ask why they don’t apply to some people. In 1977, Biden was a U.S. senator in Delaware. He communicated then that he was against desegregation. One quote now famous among conservatives was that desegregation could result in his children growing up in “a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.” In 1994, he sponsored a crime bill where-in he called the people it targeted, mostly black men, as “predators”. That legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, H.R. 3355, Pub.L. 103 — 322, has been explicitly called out by black activists as one of the most demonstrable sources of systemic racism for the way it targeted inner city blacks almost specifically. All that was all before the era of “Joe Biden gaffs” like “poor kids can be just as smart as white kids,” too. Even Kamala Harris, his now running mate, has put him to task on his uncomfortable history of backing actual racist policy makers, and even former members of the KKK. “I also believe — and it’s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,” Harris said. “There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school everyday. And that little girl was me.” Taqwa Lee III on Medium explains in “Why We Call Him Jim Crow Joe Biden.” Jim Crow was named after an insulting song lyric regarding American Descendants Of Slavery (ADOS), the laws that existed for about 100 years, from the post-Civil War era until 1968 were meant to return Southern states to an antebellum class structure by marginalizing American Descendants Of Slavery (ADOS). ADOS communities and individuals that defied Jim Crow laws often were murdered or thrown in prison. By the time Joe Biden started his political career his worldview was molded in a time of legalized racial discrimination so he quite naturally wanted to continue the legacy of that American institution of Jim Crow not only by tradition but it helped him and his progeny as well, so he did. From the first time he was elected as a Senator of Delaware in 1973 all the way up to 2009 and still continues to show us that he has never been an ally to Black Americans (ADOS), the only reason Jim Crow Joe is even running for president again, is because people have this perception of ‘uncle joe’ largely because he was Obama’s VP. That sounds very clearly like critical race theory applied in a place it rarely is -- the left. Looking at Biden’s legacy, he has worked as part of the Democratic Party, where blacks have seen a reduction in living standards, harsher conditions, more death from violent crime, increased criminalization, for nearly five decades. These stigmas are most clearly demonstrated in the areas where Democrats have the greatest controls. Conservatives are very quick to point out that when you look to the places where blacks express the greatest resentment about inequality, you find those are far more likely to be devoid of Republican leadership. Look to the recent death of George Floyd. That took place in a city ran by a Democratic police chief, with an all Democrat city council, a Democrat Mayor, in a state with a Democrat governor. And all this has been consistent for decades. But the blame? It always goes to conservative white racism and Donald Trump. But how can that be when conservatives and Republicans are strangely absent from the site of their greatest crimes against humanity? That is the party that Joe Biden has been a leader of for nearly half a century without it getting better for the people it claims to represent the most. Getting off Biden for a while, maybe we should revisit the Democrats and their history, again, keeping in mind the inescapable guilt inherit to arguments of systemic racism. The Democratic party is directly responsible for writing the darkest pages of American history. They began under Andrew Jackson as the party that ordering the exile of the Native Americans. They were the party in defense of slavery, and the party of the Confederacy. They used the Ku Klux Klan as their militant arm to terrorize and repress the black vote during Reconstruction. They were the party of Jim Crow. Later, as “the Progressive party” they were the party of eugenics and then the internment of the Japanese during World War II. And finally, right up until “the Great Switch”, they pushed the hardest against civil rights. Many of those events, such as those relating to the Civil War and black representation, have been framed as owed to “conservatives”. That, however, falls apart when realizing that the Civil War, and all later conflicts resulting around black civil rights were between two different schools of thought, that of “all men are created innately equal in the sight of God” (see Bertrand Russell, a key founder of modern conservative philosophy) and “local sovereignty of the states”. Neither of these are modern progressive ideals, but both are modern conservative values. Simply saying conservativism is “preserving the status quo” is absurd when there exists an entire conservative ideology today that was as much a part of freeing slaves as it was a part of holding them back. So blame conservatism if you like, but just like “Antifa is just an idea”, so is conservatism. But the Democratic party is a real organization and the specific burden of history lies with Democrats. But what about that Great Switch? For those unaware, this was a great enlightenment during the time of Civil Rights, where Democrats today say that everything turned around. The Democrats became the party of justice and equality and the Republicans transformed into the party of racism. Three points are generally given as proof of this switch: These facts are all incorrect. First, it assumes that the Democratic Party could evolve to no longer be racist, but Southerners themselves could not. “You’re from Georgia, and you’re white. Therefore, you’re a racist. Because Science.” Yeah, that’s not how things work. It is how bigotry works, but no other process is involved when looking at the perpetual assumption of racism of anyone born South of Mason Dixon line one hundred and fifty years after its relevance. What actually happened was that, as the South was forced to modernize, the same economic forces that made it stupid to be racist in business in the North then applied to the South. As wealth followed those who embraced blacks both as customers and employees, racism gradually diminished in the South. It’s just really hard to continue being a powerful racist when your competitor down the street is beating you because they aren’t. As racism went away and the economy of the South modernized, a new generation started joining the Republican party for its economic policies. It wasn’t the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Second, angry Democrats leaving their party sounds nice, but in actuality, there was only 1 Democratic Senator who opposed the bill and joined the Republicans. And finally, the belief that ever since, the Republicans have dominated the South ignores the fact that they didn’t hold a majority of Southern seats until 1994. The “Southern Strategy” is what many call this intentional effort to use the South’s racism by the Republicans, and is often said to be “proven” by one staffer in the 1980s who admitted that they did use a Southern Strategy, which those wanting to paint the Republicans as the real party of racism ever since have used ad nauseam. Looking at the actual evolution of the South, one where the world changed and the South changed with it, which Democrats are going to want to admit is possible, the Southern Strategy was to appeal to new values of the South, no longer trapped by an agrarian mode of thinking. In truth, even if a great switch happened, it didn’t happen in 1964, but in the 1920s. Prior to that time, Woodrow Wilson laid the groundwork for some of the most left leaning socialist programs in American history, attempting to solve American problems (for poor whites) through big spending government programs. That is the same Woodrow Wilson, famous for screening the first movie in the White House. That movie, lest it be forgotten, was Birth of a Nation, the Ku Klux Klan recruitment film, popular at the time of the Klan’s history that saw it go from a militant arm of the Democratic party in the South to a mainstream movement across the country.  Wilson’s successor was Franklin Roosevelt, who carried on the progressive legacy with the New Deal. The programs of the New Deal were intended to serve as handouts for poor whites, to raise them out of poverty through expensive government works programs and high taxes. This was particularly those still living under the economic consequences of the Civil War. One could call it the actual Southern Strategy. Poor blacks, however, having lived under centuries of actual racial oppression of Jim Crow had very good reasons then for being underserved and underprivileged. As would be naturally expected, they also sought this government relief, as well as voting for the party that wanted more of it. It wasn’t until the 1960s that these programs brought over enough poor blacks, and kept them there, that they comprised a large presence in the Democratic Party. Realizing what they had, the party’s narrative had to follow through. Then the Democrats shifted from a platform of actual white supremacy to one of black patronage, wherein blacks needed the help and patronage of the white race to achieve equal status. It was deeply condescending, but better than the last century. What was a real problem, however was the transactional nature this relationship often took, wherein blacks were given patronage by the new Democrats, but something was expected in return. President Lyndon B. Johnson illustrates that point, rather nicely, according to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. “These Negroes, they’re getting pretty uppity these days and that’s a problem for us since they’ve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we’ve got to do something about this,  we’ve got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference.  For if we don’t move at all, then their allies will line up against us and there’ll be no way of stopping them, we’ll lose the filibuster and there’ll be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. It’ll be Reconstruction all over again.” Another statement, attributed to Ronald M. MacMillan, a former Air Force One steward: “I’ll have those ni**ers voting Democratic for 200 years.” He also called the Civil Rights Act of 1957 the “ni**er bill” to Senatorial colleagues and said of appointing African-American judge Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court: “Son, when I appoint a ni**er to the court, I want everyone to know he’s a ni**er.” So… it seems not all the racist Democrats fled to the Republican Party. At least one stayed on as President. That said, given the “switch” from a supremacist outlook to one of patronage, which in hindsight unironically achieved the same conditions for those involved, it left anyone consistently believing that people should just be free to prosper on their own merit rather than being judged based on the color of their skin suddenly and miraculously going from “ for black equality”  to “ not doing enough for blacks”  to  “the real white supremacists.” All that to say that the Democratic Party cannot escape it’s own history by passing the blame on to conservatives and Republicans. They can’t suddenly decree that everyone they disagree with are fascists and Nazis to overshadow their own past. And they can’t pretend that suddenly deciding they speak for the downtrodden absolves them from the responsibility of being most responsible of the problems they blame on others. While this answer appears to be a scathing indictment of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden, it actually isn’t. It’s illustrating a point. If many of you believe as you say you say believe, that systemic racism is an inescapable sin, that the consequences of history upon which an institution is founded are to forever define the innate character of that institution and all within it, then the Democratic Party is the most irredeemable institution in all of American history. If reparations for crimes of generations past are to be paid, it is not America’s debt to be paid, but the Democrats. No one should kneel through the American anthem or call the abolition of the police if they have not already lobbied for the banning the Democratic Party, first. If America is a racist country because of it’s founders, or the times in which it was formed, or racist things it has done in the past, and nothing that has happened since matters at all, then what does that make the Democratic party? If America, or the police, white people, modern companies who bought old companies, or anyone else holds a candle of guilt, and that that guilt should burn their reputation forever, then the Democrats are unpardonable inferno. If America can’t be forgiven, then the Democratic Party has no right to exist. And Joe Biden? By the rationale of once a racist; always a racist, then someone who literally began his career pushing the last of the Jim Crow legislation and white supremacy, who pushed criminal law that targeted black “predators”, who says things like “poor kids can be just as smart as white kids”, then that person has no right to lead the party that says that centuries of systemic racism is the cause of so much social harm we face today. But… if you believe as I do, that anyone who sins is worthy of forgiveness, that everyone makes mistakes, or even that people of the past can’t be judged by today’s standards, then there’s hope. Through hard work, sacrifice, and the willingness to do better, one can unburden themselves of the guilt of past wrongs. If you believe these things, then and only then can Joe Biden be your nominee. Likewise, the Democratic Party need not always be the party of slavery, of the KKK, of lynchings, and genocide. Like America, which has suffered greatly to correct its past failures, both through shed blood and the pain of self-reformation, the Democrats can be better, too. “For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.” Of course, it only works if forgiveness is possible. If we live in a time without forgiveness, where the guilt of people long since dead is used to bludgeon the living and mostly for short term political gain, then Joe Biden’s failures are the failures of everyone who votes for him. All of them are now guilty. Every one of them who votes for him are complicit in the unforgivable crimes of his past and of the party he represents. That’s if you believe as you say you believe. Whether we’re talking about liberals, leftists, progressives, or Democrats, one side continually pushes a narrative that “America was never great.” You can quote New York's Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo on that. Those are his exact words. “America was never great.” This accusation is based on the notion that America is forever guilty of anything wrong that ever happened in its past, and that today’s “good people” have the right to judge others for past wrongs when it is politically advantageous to do so. For some people to say that, it would be one thing. But for anyone of the Democratic party to say such a thing of anyone else ever, is… well,  hypocritical  is the nicest word to call it. For the people who are the most responsible for the worst events in America’s history to say that America is flawed demands someone to say, “Now wait just a minute.” No. America is great. It was great. It has been great from the start because it put to paper the rights that allowed for the greatest freedom and prosperity available to anyone anywhere in history. Was it perfect? No, and it never will be. But it started off great and continues to get better. In a constant struggle to look inward at places where we have failed to live up to our own ideals, we’ve fought to make ourselves better. Perfect isn’t possible, but a process to perpetually be better is the best anyone could ever hope for. That process, the intentionally designed method of self-renewal and self-accountability, that is perhaps our greatest attribute of all. In closing, I’ll never accept someone who calls themselves a Democrat say that America was never great, that we are a racist nation because of our racist legacy. They are the last people who should ever have the right to say such a thing. If, however, that Democrat were to say to me, “Yeah, we’ve all done some messed up things. My side really has some skeletons in the closet. But I think I have some good ideas and I would like your help,” then I think we can get past this era of intense cross the aisle hatred that seems to be all anyone ever sees. You must have humility and you must have forgiveness, and the rules must be the same for everyone. Either we are all defined by a racist legacy or none of us are. Either you can be redeemed by trying to be better, or you can’t. But you can’t pick and choose who gets forgiveness and who is unworthy based on other political views. That, to me, is the greatest political hypocrisy in America today. Relaxed. Researched. Respectful. - "

This was a triumph of insightful, incisive interrogation. I'm being so sincere right now. In the US, Black people are far more likely to receive prison sentences for crimes than white people convicted of the same crimes under similar circumstances. Black people are less likely to be hired than equally qualified white people. Several studies have demonstrated this by taking  word for word identical  resumes, attaching a “black sounding” or “white sounding” name, and sending them to employers. Resumes with white-sounding names receive far more callbacks than identical resumes with black-sounding names. Same for apartment applications. Same for mortgage applications. Black people are far more likely to be shot by police for non-violent infractions. Police who shoot unarmed Black people are far less likely to face any consequences than police who shoot unarmed whites. If you look at the objective evidence, the points of data make a beautiful line squarely in the direction of systemic racism, though of course, it isn't racism that is of interest to those who ask questions such as this."

The question about whether men can be objectified is similar to the question of whether people who belong to a racial minority—for example, Black people in the United States—can be racist. There are two different definitions of “racism.” Racism can mean “holding prejudiced, stereotypical, or bigoted attitudes about people based on race,” by which definition Black people can and sometimes are racist. But racism can also mean “of or relating to a systemic, structural form of oppression in which members of one race oppress or deny participation in civil institutions to members of another race.” By that definition, Black people in the United States cannot be racist, because they are not the dominant race; that is, they do not control the systems of society, civil institutions, and governance. Yet when you see arguments about racism on the Internet, these two definitions get used interchangeably, so the arguments go whizzing by each side without finding their mark like so many poorly-fired arrows. The same thing happens in many conversations about feminism. Some (not all) feminists claim that men can not be objectified. Many other people, some of whom are  also  feminists, say this is complete codswallop, and point to examples of individual men being objectified all the time, or media reports that objectify men, or customs that objectify men. They’re talking past each other because they’re using different definitions of “objectification.” As with the different definitions of “racism,” the definitions of “objectification” can look at an individual or a structural level. On an individual level, objectification is what happens when one person disregards another person’s humanity. Can men be objectified? Yes, absolutely. It’s self-evidently clear that they can be. It’s not even hard to find examples. Of course men can be objectified! On a structural level, “objectification” means a pattern of institutionalized behavior where a dominant group treats a subordinate group as second-class citizens, or deprives them of their personhood altogether. By  this  definition, men can’t be objectified, because men  are  the dominant group. And so you’ll see flame wars and indignant arguments flying all around each other on Internet forums like so many angry hornets, and none of the arguments will stick because the folks making the arguments don’t stop to consider that they’re using the same word in two entirely different ways. This is what happens when you assume that other people use language the same way you do."

The behavior of the people wrt to the Sudanese guy can be attributed majorly to curiosity. Anything that's out of place grabs human attention. That is our nature.

However, as far as the question of India being a racist country is concerned, answer to that would be a resounding  YES . Maybe, 'our racism' is a bit different from the western concept, but it does exist in the form of deeply entrenched caste system, stereotypes and prejudices in our society. So, we not only have castes, we have sub-castes too (gotras). We have Dalits, the Harijans, Brahmins, Baniyas and what not. To make matters more complicated, we have further preconceived notions based on the place a person comes from. So, while Northies look down upon the 'Madrasi' way of eating rice by hands, the Southerners probably think that the Northies are only good enough for the Bhangra. The Bengalis are supposed to be intellectuals, and every half-decent Bihari is supposed to crack IAS. There are the 'Chinkis' from the north-east, and the 'Bhaiyyas' from UP.  And then we have the national obsession for the  whiter  skin. From 'Fair and Lovely' to matrimonial ads in the daily newspaper - its all indicative of our bias for the 'fairer complexion'. And of course, then there is religion. We are practising racism in just too many ways! We might not say it or admit it, but ultimately its what we do that defines us."

It is never about Trump. It is about the anger, fear, and resentment from the people who felt that they’re being wronged and ignored. Trump is not a leader, Trump and his cohort (the republican house representatives and senators, and the conservative media) are enablers. Trump didn’t create anything new. The rage and contempt were already there. Trump simply told them “It’s OK to let it out”. And our system (politicians and police force) told them “there won’t be any consequences”. That’s why these people praised Trump for “telling it as it is”. Because it means they get to express their racism and bigotry freely without consequences. That’s why it doesn’t matter what Trump did, doesn’t matter how outrageous it was, these people do not care. I’m willing to go even further to say that Trump supporters didn’t care about Trump as a person. They care about what Trump and his cohort allows them to do. If tomorrow Trump has a stroke and dies, these people will promote the same hatred and violence fueled by their anger and fear. So no. The problem isn’t Trump. The problem is our system, and how it lets people like Trump get away with things. It is our system that, through racism in education, racism in our culture, created generation after generation of people who believe in an “us vs them” mentality, who believes in “wealth = virtue” and who worship wealthy people… So no. These people won’t feel like they’re being “sold out” by Trump. Trump has become more and more irrelevant. Soon they’ll find some other racist asshat to worship. What really scary is when they find a machiavellian smart asshat to worship.

Merriam-Webster  defines    racism a bit more distinctly: ""a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race."" Between the two, you have what most people believe about racism. It’s a good definition, and operating by it has served us well. We’re objectively one of the least racist countries in the world and, at least until about 2013, we’ve only been getting better. But recent changes in the way racism is framed have fundamentally changed the word’s meaning, at least in practice. And, in all honesty, it’s a giant hairy mess. Deconstructing the modern-day meaning of the word “racism” is the only way to understand how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ideals—that one day his kids would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character—absolutely do not apply anymore. “Privilege” The idea of  privilege  entered the cultural lexicon as little more than a list of assumptions and generalizations about the power and luxury afforded to different classes and groups. It began when I was very young, with phrases like “a privileged upbringing” (referring to someone who is very wealthy). The term always carried with it a hint of shame and guilt. Later, the idea of privilege no longer meant simply being rich. Any group which people decided has been historically empowered against a different group (according to what can only be called a bizarre list of unfalsifiable assumptions, generalization, and dichotomies) became “privileged.” The idea of privilege was couched in the language of neo-Marxism and steeped in the concept of “oppression,” where everyone was either the oppressor or the oppressed. Men had male privilege; women were disadvantaged as a result. The old had privilege, while the young did not. Rich had privilege when compared to the poor. “Abled” people were privileged, and the “disabled” were not. All straights oppressed all LGBTQ, all Christians oppressed all other religions. Ignore the fact that these generalizations were antithetical to traditional liberal values (one of the foremost of which is “don’t make generalizations“). These hasty and often contradictory generalizations were now discussed as indisputable fact in many college classrooms and activist circles. It was a strange new blood libel that was beyond question. It wasn’t just that the privileged were blessed or fortunate in some way. No, we were shifting into an era where the mere existence of a difference (in some cases the mere  perception  of a difference) between two particular groups created some measurable disparity between them. And if there was a disparity, it became a zero-sum game. The group which was privileged won, and the non-privileged group(s) lost. And the benefit which privileged groups derived from their privilege could only have come about via  intentional actions  taken by that privileged group throughout history to ensure that it remained privileged and the other groups remained oppressed. Worse yet, only certain exceptions were allowed to be made. Never mind the fact that “some whites are poor.” That was covered in interclass conflict, but there was a hierarchy to privilege, wherein your white privilege mattered more than the oppression you received from being poor.   Being poor didn’t matter as much as being white, simply put. So, by the beginning of 2010s, a new and obnoxious phrase became both a progressive rallying cry and an undefeatable rhetorical tool, handy for shutting down opposing views. “Check your privilege.” It was a tyrannical form of social censorship that disallowed nearly everyone from voicing their views, experience, knowledge, or even raw facts—because the individual was deemed bereft of the correct characteristics to participate in the debate. I take it back—that’s not really accurate. You could be white, or male, or Christian, or rich  if  you spoke against your group as an “advocate” of the “other.” That was totally fine, and in practice, the only acceptable position for one with “privilege.” For those of us who first encountered this sort of thing college (and have been encountering it ever since), it’s a familiar pattern. A white man could silence another white man if the first white man was an ally of black women (or the oppressed group  du jour ). Essentially, white privilege was the privilege of being intimidated with accusations of racism by people who see nothing else about you but the color of your skin, and believe you share the blame for the crimes of people of that same skin color to whom you are unrelated, and whom you have never met. Something else that was going on: many people were seeing that racism was more commonly shown by nonwhites towards whites than the reverse. Racism against whites suddenly became a thing, and everyone talked about it. A 2013 Rasmussen poll showed that most Americans, including blacks, felt blacks were more racist than whites and Hispanics. The results of this poll have been replicated numerous times since, most recently this year.  Numerous other inconsistencies were piling up in race-based discussions. Despite the left’s claims to the contrary, there was a distinct lack of supporting evidence that the police were systematically targeting and murdering blacks. Or that the economic inequality in black neighborhoods was actually caused by policies dating from the 1960s rather than white racism. Rather than address these inconsistencies, however, the left doubled down, pushing for stronger forms of affirmative action. Colleges and corporations instituted racial quotas, and minority students and job seekers were selected over better-qualified white candidates. Criticizing these obviously racist and illegal practices was viewed as racism and could get you fired. However, student newspapers printing articles saying “your [white] DNA is an abomination” (written by a Hispanic female student) were tolerable, even celebrated as free speech. What happened was that the old familiar definition of “racism” which we all grew up with had been intentionally transformed by the artificially applied context of oppression. Now, “treating someone differently based on the color of their skin” wasn’t sufficient, as it pointed to far too many examples of blatant racism among the wrong people. The left adapted by changing the definition of racism to Racism = Prejudice + Power That massive leap acknowledged the difference between prejudice and racism. Prejudice now became a negative feeling towards some generalized groups, whereas racism was racial prejudice  in practice . But it included the idea of “power.” Power could mean many things, but in the new paradigm,  privilege  meant power. And going back to what we discussed earlier, it became unacceptable to generalize about any group except for privileged ones. It became acceptable to say that all whites were privileged and all blacks were oppressed. As our first black president took office, progressives claimed—with straight faces—that blacks systemically could not have power and… here’s the big one…  black people could not be racist. It’s important to understand that wealthy whites who, by and large, live lives segregated from the problems of blacks and other minorities, but close enough to be aware of it, don’t experience these problems. Here’s a racial dot map of New York City. Look and see that the liberal dominated epicenter of culture and wealth is one of the most segregated cities in the world. That is to say, wealthy whites experience the problems of racism  theoretically . They feel bad about the obvious disparity they witness. It’s hard to say privilege doesn’t exist when you were born into an area where all the white people live in nice homes and all the black people blocks away don’t. I get the guilt, but that experience isn’t universal. The sense of guilt is why so people many push to make things better for blacks, but rarely push anything that will tangibly affect themselves. They aren’t actually affected by new policy or theory and don’t suffer any reduction in opportunity or change in their way of life. But  poor  whites, such as those in rural districts and the Rust Belt, bear the brunt of these new “balancing the scales of history” measures. They are forced to work even harder with less (declining education standards and economic opportunities). In the United States, poor white people outnumber poor black people by 3 to 1. There are almost as many poor whites as there are blacks of any economic standing, period. But because a higher  proportion  of the African-American population is poor, the actual numbers of poor whites and poor blacks become irrelevant. In truth, whites and blacks in America are poor for the same reason. Blindly attributing poverty to racial issues, as many wealthier and more liberal whites do (disconnected, as they are, from the experiences of rural whites) is a mistake. This approach misses the actual source of many common problems. Often, as is made abundantly clear in the book  Please Stop Helping Us  by Jason Riley, the causes of poverty are themselves the unintended consequences of many poorly thought-out measures to  help  the poor, black or white. Instead, these policies make it even more difficult for poor whites to get ahead, and even lay the groundwork for saying that hatred by other races  isn’t racism  if it’s directed towards them. Remember, these are people who actually interact, as opposed to areas segregated by wealth. When we say that “black people can’t be racist,” it immediately and demonstrably creates an environment of animosity where bigotry towards poor whites is acceptable. Sad as it is to say, we are far from done. Some good news is that, despite whatever you may think, and despite the events of the last decade, America is objectively one of the least racist countries in the world. Various studies, such as this study from the early 2010s, have been conducted. These studies typically ask participants if they’d be OK with someone of another race living next to them. Most American participants answer “yes.” The United States, regardless of its current racial obsession (or perhaps because of it), is one of the most tolerant in the world. We’re actually the least racist right now than we’ve ever been, again by objective measurements and not perceptions. That’s something good and we should be happy about it. But we’re not. For various reasons, various groups gain a great deal of influence, power, and funding through furthering racial narratives. In so doing, they advance the idea of the “deep racism” in American culture. Whether this news is within the Overton window or not, America is far more racially tolerant than most places on the planet. Be happy. But inequalities still exist. Unless someone really wants to bite the bullet and say that decades of social science pointing to white racism as the cause of society’s inequalities was wrong, progressives have only two options: contest the data, or change the narrative on prejudice. How can they account for racial inequalities in a way that maintains narratives of oppression, when all evidence shows racism (at least the one we care about) has an inverse relationship with the inequality we’re angry about? Enter “unconscious bias.” Unconscious bias, alternately called “implicit bias,” states that even if people aren’t outwardly racist, or even if they don’t internally hold racist views, or  are even trying to do the least racist thing possible  even where it doesn’t make sense to frame a problem around race , racially prejudicial feelings lie within our subconscious minds affecting our conscious thoughts and actions. In effect, no matter what we think or do, we are still racist deep down inside. Of course, there’s little objective evidence for this, which is why so many scientists disagree with the validity of not just the tests  , but the notion.  Most of the tests for unconscious bias center around forcing people to make snap judgments based on the oppression matrix I shared previously. These tests don’t measure  if  unconscious bias is real, but  to what extent  a person is biased based on the time they spent giving their response—down to fractions of a second. This is not enough to form a valid social theory, let alone enough to justify sweeping policy changes for an entire nation. Yet that’s what we’re doing. Many of the “corrective policies” regarding race assume that racism, particularly white racism, is still the driving factor behind inequality. Racism leaches from deep within the minds of those in power, unbeknownst to even them, trickling into our laws, culture norms, and societal mores from the highest to the lowest levels. Where it can’t be proven that a person, or even whole groups, have a racially biased culture, racism is still blamed—thanks to the idea of unconscious bias, an accusation which no one can ever even defend themselves against. Essentially, no matter how hard we try, we are all racists. Don’t forget, however, that thanks to the dynamics of power and oppression, people of color  can’t  be racist. Let that stew for a while. It’s a problem because these anti-racist policies  do  hurt some people. Poor whites are again disadvantaged here. People are trained that they must recognize and compensate for their unconscious bias, and that certain groups (oppressed groups) are always the victims of this unconscious bias. It is then suggested that the way to do this is to show favoritism toward the groups delineated by oppression-based theories. The decision-makers then feel compelled to compensate for their own bias by looking for some reason to fail a white candidate for a position or opportunity. Again, this is  actual racism . In practice. Following its singular evolution, the word “racism” was no longer a thing that people did to people of a different color. It wasn’t even prejudice, the views people had. It was something that whites did to peoples of color without even meaning to. Now we’ll shift the discussion of racism to a different realm: from the individual to the institution. Institutional racism, also called “systemic racism,” occurs when racism is built into the bylaws and policies of an organization. Slavery, and subsequently Jim Crow laws, which tried to prevent black participation in electoral process, and permitted businesses to discriminate against blacks by segregating them to separate facilities or barring them from entry completely, are examples of institutional racism. They are rules on the books intended to treat one race differently. The prevailing argument today is that  institutional  racism from America’s past, rules that were practiced hundreds of years ago, affect the lives of people today. The theory is that institutions which were around during those dark times and still survive today are forever marked by their “racist legacy.” Racism was present at their inception and for that reason, it has informed all follow-up decisions which the organization has made and its development, all the way up to the present day. Put differently, adherents of the theory of systemic racism say that whether or not racism exists in  individuals , it exists at the  organizational  level. This is particularly true if those organizations and institutions were created during racist epochs, having inherited the racism of their founders, who subtly built racism into the very structure. It really doesn’t matter what events have transpired since then, what reforms have been made, or what apologies or policy changes these organizations have made—even when racist employees or members were purged, or racist policies stricken either by an act of law, or by the institution itself, voluntarily. The extremist view (which is gaining significant steam) is that an organization that  in any way  held a different standard of ethics than we do today, be it racism, sexism, or otherwise, is irredeemable and must atone for its crimes or be abolished. If the institution existed during a time more racist than today, they are part of whatever problems exist for racial minorities at present and therefore… racist. Worse still, any greater institution, such as the United States itself, which doesn’t solve the problem as the accusers see fit, is a bastion of institutional racism, and by that argument, a racist country. The problem with this idea is that it leverages history selectively. Systemic racism did exist. I gave examples of it. Jim Crow was systemic racism. But the Civil War was also fought, in large part, to end one form of systemic racism. Numerous bills were passed following in the aftermath to end systemic racism further, leading to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made it illegal to treat people differently based on race. That didn’t make racism magically go away, but provided a legal framework for unfair policies in any organization to be challenged and for any racist policies to be stricken from the books. It preserves the organization, but removes the immoral parts. But modern proponents of systemic racism want to go further.  Whole institutions  which have a legacy of disparity, or are held to be guilty of racism in some way, shape, or form in the modern day, must be abolished in their entirety. The police are a good example of this. In spite of numerous studies demonstrating that police do  not  target blacks specifically, high-profile examples of white cops killing blacks have led to the widely believed assumption that the police are racist. Even in places where investigations show that the police are not acting in racist ways, in traditionally Democratic districts, with black chiefs of police and Democratic city councils, mayors, and governors, white racism is believed to be the cause of disproportionate violence perpetrated against black people by white cops. Administrators are absolved of all responsibility; the eternal bogeyman of racism is to blame. Where it can’t be proven that current racism explains a regrettable event,  historic  racism in the institution (the police, in this case) does. The police are  institutionally  racist, meaning that they will forever be racist because it is written into the system. Again, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was about finding and identifying the specific causes of racial disparity written into the system and removing them without breaking the system. The system matters. While it may not be perfect, it works. While you be disadvantaged for a time, you do not face the consequences of famine and war. Getting rid of the system gets rid of the good as well as the bad. It’s throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It is wisest to correct a system’s problems without destroying the system entirely and causing untold pain and woe to everyone dependent upon and existing within that system. That was the chief victory of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, not in removing racism, but allowing the system to correct itself over time. Eventually, once all the racist laws and corporate policies are systematically removed, we’ll have a functioning structure where people will be free to raise themselves up to equality. At that point, whatever inequalities still remain will not be due to racism, but other factors. Such processes take time. Undoing norms that have existed since the dawn of human civilization takes time, but time is better than famine and war. The idea of systemic racism does away with all that logic. An institution that has, for any reason, profited from or practiced racism in any way must be abolished to make up for past sins. This is the current argument against the police, where a need for vengeance is masked in nonsensical and unworkable plans to create better communities by getting rid of the police all together. Yeah, that won’t cause any  . Why have these almost predictably destructive ideas taken root? That has to do with something else we need to talk about: critical race theory. First, a basic definition: Critical theory is a social philosophy pertaining to the reflective assessment and critique of society and culture in order to reveal and challenge power structures. Critical theory, race or otherwise, tries to identify, criticize, and undermine social institutions by viewing them from “the perspective” of disenfranchised or marginalized groups. Like Howard Zinn’s  A People’s History of the United States,  Critical theory tries to reframe anything it views from the perspective of those who haven’t prospered under it, often going as far as to say that those systems were built to oppress them. Mind you, there is no  one  perspective of any group, unless we really want to say that all blacks have the same experience, or all women, or all anything. So the assumptions of marginalization are from “advocates” who speak for the whole population, whether anyone asked them to or not. These assumptions are also based on many of the same faulty metrics and produce wildly aggressive revisionist versions of history from the perspective of the “victims”. This can be seen in works like the New York Times’  1619 Project,  where revisionists have reframed American history around the implicit desire to enshrine slavery and the subjugation of blacks—even calling Abraham Lincoln a white supremacist. There are critical theories about everything on our our privilege axes, all producing nearly identical theories about how society was in some way manufactured with the expressed purpose of subjugating those on the bottom half of the axes. Only the supporting evidence changes, but the narrative of oppressor/oppressed remains. Despite the obvious fallacies involved in such a framework of thought, evidence to support it is abundant. That’s because history is an ugly place filled with things we would no longer countenance. Or perhaps it’s better to say that the ease of 21st-century civilization gives us the luxury to judge those who came before us. Critical theory doesn’t investigate how society has evolved, but instead looks to the history of any institution, be it the United States, Christianity, the US Army, the nuclear family ( ), with the purpose of finding some evidence of its wrongdoing and inherent injustice. If the United States, at one time, supported racism (by engaging in slavery, for example), then the reforms made, the Civil War fought, the laws created to remove the power of racism don’t matter. Critical theory does not account for attempts made to improve the institution, only the negative weight of the institution’s misdeeds. This skewed approach justifies its adherents’ view that some predetermined group is marginalized today based on events which happened in the past. Specifically, this is done with the goal of reducing, and even destroying, the power of the institution in question. With all of that said, we need to talk about the left’s habit of inventing of institutions that need to be criticized. And that’s how we’ve arrived at the mother of all racist ideas,  “Cancel Whiteness.” The new social theory of whiteness (as a social construct) takes the ideas of institutional racism and critical theory to their absolute limit. For our definition of “whiteness,” we will defer to the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture: Whiteness refers to the ways white people and their traditions, attitudes and ways of life have been normalized over time and are now considered standard practice in the United States. And since white people still hold most of the institutional power in America, we have all internalized some aspects of white culture — including people of color. Which is to say that, in America, due to… (a) that thing called “privilege” (b) the preconceived notion that all relationships within a society are based on power (c) and the idea that one’s place in society is a zero-sum game, and (d) the theory that absolutely  everything is about race …the mere fact that different groups have  coexisted with one another  throughout history has enabled one group to make itself superior to the other groups, and then consolidate their exalted position in society by promulgating pro-white traditions, attitudes, and “ways of life,” which have subsequently leached into our institutions and even into people of color, systematically keeping certain groups low and white people high. In other words, our race—which is prevalent in absolutely everything we do or say, every attitude we hold, every tradition we observe, every aspect of our lives—makes it harder for others and we should hold some sense of obligation to minimize the effects of our culture on them, even in our most mundane and innocuous cultural norms and practices. The idea of whiteness doesn’t acknowledge the fact that the same thing happens literally everywhere on Earth. There are social norms in India, China, and Africa. There are social norms I don’t even know exist, but that I’d better learn to adapt to if I were to move there. This opinion that others should assimilate into our culture by adapting to our norms, or even that we are successful as a culture because of these norms, it is a racist notion—but only if the culture demanding assimilation is a white culture. What specifically is mentioned? You’d be surprised at some of the things that the Smithsonian Institute are “too white”. Individual effort and traditional families  are too white. Both reason and religion  in America are too white. Wealth, being on time, and thinking ahead  are all too white. Our holidays and the concept of law  is too white. Competitiveness  is too white. Finally, communicating well and being polite  are too white. What this report is attempting to do is to list many of the traits common to Occidental culture (though also present in many other successful cultures) and stigmatize the very behaviors which make those cultures successful with a narrative of racial oppression. Being on time, nurturing strong families, working hard, taking responsibility, communicating effectively, etc. are simply behaviors that produce cultures that survive and thrive, as opposed to cultures which stagnate and die. That our culture is doing them isn’t something to stigmatize or be ashamed of. By its very nature, whiteness is oppressive to all other people throughout the world, innately subjugating them in subtle ways, especially those unfortunate enough to be forced to emigrate here. That’s because Western predominance forces the rest of the world’s people to subjugate themselves to white history, white culture, white ideas, and the damnable tyranny of being expected to clock in on time. Viewed through the context of critical theory, we see why whiteness causes harm and, if you are against racism in the form of institutional racism, you must therefore cancel whiteness. None of this is explicitly saying that white people should be punished or wiped out. Well, that’s not  totally  true. Sarah Jeong of  The New York Times  tweeted out a series of racist tweets against whites all the way back in 2014. And quite honestly, there are a lot of people who say these things outright. But rarely does this and even more explicitly violent racist talk directed towards whites get any major pushback. “Whiteness,” for now, is about saying that many, many behaviors common to white cultures are actually  harmful  to people of other races, as they were built for and by whites to empower themselves. The idea of whiteness combines many of previously discussed ideas—implicit bias, systemic racism, white privilege, and critical race theory—to suggest to people in positions of power that the only way to correct for the past is to “balance the scales” today. How? By taking actions which show preferential treatment to nonwhites in ways that, to 3rd-grade me anyway, seem pretty racist. Moving on. Let’s say you’re reader somewhere on the left. You might be a liberal, a progressive, or maybe a centrist. You might even be a conservatives who thinks I’ve gone too far. Somewhere in this write-up, I’ve said something many of you disagree with. Perhaps I was too vague somewhere, or perhaps I generalized too much. Okay. That’s fine. I’ve had to cover a lot of territory in a relatively short amount of space. You have the comments to hash it out. I like to engage with respectful people, if I have time, and go deeper where I can. It’s important that when we disagree that we first seek to understand the other person. That’s not to force them to agree with us, but to be more right ourselves. But there are others who would say differently. There are many who would say that this entire answer—anything I could have ever written critical towards the evolution of the idea of “racism”—is itself a form of racism. How? Because it is proof of my “white fragility.” It’s believed by many that we need to “talk about race.” We do, but not in the way they often mean. The Smithsonian Institution’s guide is one such example of how they think we need to talk about race. An older term is “have a national discussion.” The implication is that we aren’t already talking about race or having a discussion unless and until certain agreements are reached and concessions are made. We must talk about it until people agree with all the points I’ve listed above, including specific policy recommendations I’ve haven’t even talked about, and if we don’t, we really haven’t had a talk. That’s not a talk and it’s not a discussion. That’s a one-sided lecture, sometimes a sermon, and sometimes an interrogation demanding us to admit our guilt to crimes we didn’t commit. America doesn’t need to be lectured on race by people I’ve demonstrated can’t and  won’t  even agree on what racism means. My continued presence on the other side of the argument—actually having the discussion but not agreeing with the narratives—makes me “fragile.” If you disagree, you’re being defensive, and demonstrating fear or guilt. The assumptions of the white race are, in this case, beyond question, and anyone disagreeing shows “fear and guilt”. Never mind the possibility that they may be pointing out legitimately fallacious flaws in your logic or ideology, and never mind that their facts may better explain the narrative than the ideologues’. Literally any response, save acquiescence—arguing, silence, or even leaving the conversation—are evidence of white fragility. I have to ask the question now: How fragile is your ideology if it needs to codify dissent as proof of its opponents’ guilt? Debate—and the meticulous dissection of ideas in search of flaws and inconsistencies—is necessary to finding truth, and truth is necessary to solving problems. The “fragility” rhetoric can, and is, copied-and-pasted into literally every “marginalized group” on the axes of oppression. Nothing even needs to be restated other than the adjective of “white” or “male” or “straight.” It’s an unfalsifiable  ad hominem  against people who disagree for any reason. If your ideology faces so much criticism that it must stigmatize the criticism rather than acknowledge and correct for the faults, then it isn’t a valid theory. It’s not a theory at all. It’s little different than a bad religion, or a cult. Lastly, “anti-racism.” Ibram Kendi, the author of the book  How to Be an Anti-Racist  says, “There’s no such thing as being ‘not racist.’ We are either being racist or antiracist.” Anti-racism is a new movement within the racial debate. Anti-racism says that simply being “not racist” isn’t enough. Being tolerant and being inclusive aren’t enough. You must be  actively fighting against  the forces of racism to be considered an “anti-racist.” It isn’t just about saying, “I don’t support the KKK or Nazis. Everything in this answer so far is the ‘forces of racism.’” And unless you fight all of them… you’re a racist. Kendi breaks from the definition of racism I stated earlier, believing that race is the primary determinant of human traits and that some races are distinctly better. He defines racism as: ""One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions  or inaction  or  expressing a racist idea. "" Who determines what actions are enough, or which ideas are racist? The same people who say that being on time or working hard are too white, or that all whites and all blacks have the same experiences and can therefore be generalized as one oppressed the other merely by existing, or that history only matters if it’s bad and that reforms to bring about equality don’t count. Nearly anything an average person could or would believe falls under “racist ideas.” The idea that some elite class of activists gets to determine what “racist ideas” are or aren’t should set off more red flags than a May Day Parade in Moscow. There’s a whole host of “you’re either with us or you’re against us” problems that opens up. It gets even worse in this Forbes article,  5 Disturbing Signs That You Might Not Be An Antiracist After All   . Indeed, while the discrimination focus in years past was rejecting blatant, egregious, confederate flag flying, “where did I put my hood” white supremacist racists, in 2020 there seems to be much more focus on the middle of the road, self-proclaimed white progressives who dangerously straddle the fence just enough to allow the fire to rage on. While they may reject racism in its most obvious and overt variety, they haven’t necessarily made concrete changes in their daily lives to fully embrace antiracism. The article attacks people for not speaking up soon enough or loud enough, not explaining why they didn’t do more, and not personally sacrificing something. It even claims that people who the anti-racist crowd have deemed to be racists are too comfortable around you  is itself a form of racism . I’ll repeat that last one. You’re a racist if people  they think are racists  don’t hate you. How is it possible to argue that someone is guilty of thought crime based on the actions of other people? How is that a real thing? It is this “nothing is ever good enough” mentality that fundamentalist regimes throughout the world and throughout history have used to indoctrinate extremists. Fundamentalist rhetoric is deadly—most of all to people nearest the movement. The sort of progressives and liberals called out in the article will be the first attacked for noncompliance and they will suffer the most if they don’t comply perfectly. No one is allowed to disagree on a single point, even if they agreed with 99% of everything else that was said. Those most indoctrinated have privileged speaking rights, and those who don’t follow the doctrine and dogmas are to be punished first. No part of me is speaking hyperbolically to say we’re dealing with pure fundamentalism. That is to say, unless you agree with literally every notion I’ve demonstrated thus far —  you are a racist. I could go on. That’s the issue. “Anti-racism” is fundamentalist rhetoric applied to racism in America. It says that you must agree with all the many flawed narratives surrounding racism, agree with literally any piece of legislation called anti-racist, and never criticize any of them, campaign for policy that isn’t grounded in reality, and do it so loudly as to place your jobs and relationships at risk. If you don’t, you’ll suffer for it, because you’re a racist and  . To answer the question fully, the definition of racism remains the same as it always was to most Americans: ""a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race."" Most people still believe that. But that isn’t the script which the hardliners who control the narrative are using. That group includes many policy-makers, activists, media figures, and most of academia. They are functioning under a different set of assumptions than most of us, and they prize their views to such an extent that questioning them is… well, racist. And they’ll punish us for saying so. So we go along with it. Partly, it’s because commonly understood ideas like racism and their implications can change radically in a single decade. This answer was difficult to write, not just because of everything that went into to, but because of everything left out. Very little of this was talked about ten years ago. Partly, it’s because the systems which perpetuate this rhetoric are so vast and pervasive, and the ideologues are so inured to it, that no amount of reasoning or discussion can make a dent in the ideology. Discussion that isn’t a one-sided lecture is racist to the advocates of these ideas. What hope could there be? But also, it’s because so many of us fear being called racists ourselves. Throughout my life, racism has not been something that has been tolerated, at least not when whites do it. It is a moral evil and frankly, the universal acceptance of that fact is why the extremism I’ve listed is tolerable. The fear of being labelled a racist is so great that people don’t push back against the excess. They don’t say, “No. I’m not a racist. I disagree with racism. Racism is evil. But this stuff you’re saying. It’s wrong and it’s crazy.” Why? Because they’ve seen how their friends who did it before were treated. It’s not worth sticking your neck out to be attacked by a radicalized friend or family member. It’s not worth being ostracized, dogpiled on, bullied, stalked, or harassed online — fired. So little bit by little bit, things get worse. Notice that this era isn’t making things better for blacks either. Prescribing medicines when you’ve failed to diagnose the real disease will only make the patient sicker. So the meaning of racism has changed. The definition may still  read  the same, but what started off as a description of an attitude is now a weaponized term used to intimidate some, radicalize others, and create far more hatred on all sides. Relaxed. Researched. Respectful. - "

Then my delusions of superiority are confirmed. But put one in power, give him wealth, give him equality (god for bid superiority) and watch white people complain about the world! There’s a chorus on the far right that is accurate in pointing out that there is a lot more racial tension now, but not because of blacks, but because blacks are tired of being swept aside. Inspired by a black president, they’ve started acting up and fighting against the systemic racism that they’ve been generally turning a blind-eye to. Some white people, content in their echo chambers and unmolested by white men residing in the WHITE HOUSE, felt that since they weren’t seeing the racism with their own eyes, that things were getting better. Because, well, as long as they couldn’t see it, I guess it was okay. This is classic “1950’s mentality”. Hide the problem, sweep it under the rug. Leave it in the past. Just … let’s not talk about it. Lastly, there is one big difference. Something different about our world today than pre 2008. We are so used to rapid technological changes that we are so accustomed to this thing in our life that wasn’t there before. We have this thing on us all the time now. It captures images and voice with incredible clarity. It never goes away and that thing can move the images and voice and video to the internet with speeds unimaginable just 10 years ago. Because of that thing, no matter where a cop goes, he’s being watched by the whole world. That power didn’t exist by the billions before Obama. It does today. Because of that power, white people cannot deny what happens to black people all the time and black people now know that they were right all along and it’s available for your viewing pleasure just a few clicks away."

On this basis I concluded that I was right to think what I previous thought, which was: Hong Kong society on the other hand, has a much more hierarchical class system than Britain. It also discriminates, entirely unflinchingly, on the basis of race. What’s more, it’s utterly un-selfconscious about both. Its racial and class hierarchy is explicit, universally acknowledged, and entirely unapologetic. I spoke to a Japanese friend about this, who was asking me about my reflections on life in Hong Kong. I said, the first thing everyone wanted to know was, “what race are you?” She told me “all Asian countries are like that. The idea that your race doesn’t matter is a Western idea. It doesn’t exist in Asia”. The second thing they wanted to know was “how much money do you have?” She told me “that’s peculiarly Hong Kong”. Britain is probably the most stridently egalitarian and class-structure-lacking countries I’ve ever seen. Yet the peculiar thing is, it still obsesses over itself, as if it has a class structure. I’ve come to the conclusion over the years, that Britain’s relationship with the idea of a “class structure” is a peculiar and complex one. It’s more about what people think other people think, than what those mythical “other” people actually do think. Would Britain be a really wonderful place without its “infamous” class system? Well, my answer to this is, it is a really wonderful place and it doesn’t have much of a class system."

It’s… I suspect it’s not the majority opinion, but it is mine. I’m from Louisiana—it’s where I was born, where much of my family lives. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. I grew up visiting a plantation house in my mother’s side of the family. I grew up visiting those southern small towns that are so often a part of southern conservative nostalgia. I grew up visiting relatives in places that had dime operated soda machines from the 1950s still in operation, small mom and pop stores that still sold homemade candy for pocket change. I grew up visiting places where the churches were still tiny and attached to graveyards going back hundreds of years, where off-roading on three wheelers and fishing were a major source of entertainment, and where nearly everyone farmed or hunted. I grew up places where, if I happened to run into a black person, they apologized and did not make eye contact, where a man or woman more than twice my age flinched on making it to the door just before me, in a culture where age means authority. I grew up visiting a grandfather who had black maids, sitting in the kitchen while the black cook worked and pestering her while she answered what must have been an utterly annoying and inane set of questions from a white child with the utmost respect, because I was white, in a culture where otherwise, children were to be seen and not heard. I grew up listening to fear about black people rioting. I grew up being told to stay indoors because black people were animals, that any civility they displayed was only a light gloss on an underlying animality that would burst forth from time to time when they were upset, and was the rule of their lives in urban settings. I grew up being told that slavery was for the benefit of black people, because they could not take care of themselves, the savages. I grew up being told that the north oppressed us and that the Civil War was to protect us from that oppression. I grew up hearing that black people loved being slaves, that the rumors about slavery being violently, sadistically oppressive were just things northerners said to make people unhappy with southerners. I grew up hearing that black people were monkeys, were not fully human. My grandmother sat me down and told me that she was taught in public school that the features of black people were a sign that they were, at best, demi-human. I grew up hearing that interracial relationships or, god forbid, children made one irretrievably contaminated, unfit for good society. I grew up visiting homes with slaves’ quarters slowly crumbling into the ubiquitous kudzu in an otherwise mowed yard, being told they were for “domestic help” and signs that we “took care of them” as benevolent masters. I grew up being told when I could and could not go camping, because the KKK was holding a rally in the local woods. I am 42 years old. These things are in living memory, and in fact I suspect if I were to visit the right set of relatives, common dinner table topics despite what people seem to believe is our current state of enlightenment. I hear references to these things and things like them in mainstream media, coming from the mouths of people  who are not from the south , coming from the mouths of members of the Trump administration. I hear references to it in every single solitary myth about urban areas, about who uses social services, every time someone speculates that a black person is not in their position because they earned it, but because of affirmative action. Any time we discuss making sure no one is cheating the system, I hear those myths over and over. I hear those dog whistles very clearly. I grew up learning about them, a special education which underpinned the education I got in schools. Those dog whistles were meant to make me feel special, to make me want to cling harder to the white people around me. They were meant to make me feel justified, to make me feel like I just worked harder, was fundamentally better than black people and anyone who wasn’t white. They were meant to make me believe that I was the best my society had to offer—white, intelligent, educated, middle class background, world-traveled. I remember being horrified the first time someone black and twice or more my age flinched away from me, dropping their eyes to avoid eye contact for fear of me. Horror. Absolute, total, gut-wrenching horror. I tried to apologize to the woman but she hurried off, afraid of me. I hadn’t hit puberty and I was terrifying. Given the history of what happens to black people who interact with white women and girls, let alone the history of lynching, I can’t blame her. It took until February of this year, 2019, to make lynching a federal crime. That education was an education in how to be a monster, and it probably would have worked to help me to fit in better. I see traces of it in quite a few of the interactions I observe of people here in the US, especially across groups of apparent ethnicity. I see it in liberal and conservative bastions, and as long as no one says racism, it couldn’t possibly be a problem. We are sick, America, and no amount of denying it has ever healed our sickness. It never will. We are profoundly ill, and racism is one of the illnesses that beset us. Trump would not be in office if he hadn’t tapped that fear after a black president. People complain about economics, but their examples about who are cheating the system, who they have to be protected from, are almost always black (or Hispanic.) People complain about discussing racism, because if you mention it, you summon it to befoul the discussion. For the record, you couldn’t summon it so easily if it wasn’t an omnipresent part of the political landscape. And naming a phenomenon is something that happens  after  it occurs, not something conjured from thin air on the use of the word. I can remember arguing with people, and still do on occasion, who want to believe that racism is not a problem, that we have laws now and have conquered it. I argue with people who think racism is something that mostly happened in the beginning of the twentieth century or maybe just a problem of inbred hicks in the south—I regret to inform you we are not inbred hicks. People who want to believe that enduring a black president was all they ever had to contribute to solving the problem. People who want to believe that enduring a black co-worker (whom they believe is there only because of their race) is the sum of the tolerance required of them. People who believe that having a black neighbor or friend absolves them of the problem of racism. The nice thing about the Trump presidency is how very naked it makes our racism. Blush and look away if you like, but the rotting naked zombie of racism in our history is right there, living its best half-life in the person of our president and his cabinet. Trump’s presidency pulls the comforting fig leaf off our denial, off the pretensions that we have to being “over” the problem. We are decidedly  not  over being racist as a nation, which would be obvious from how hard we deny it if it wasn’t from the copious amounts of evidence we have on the topic in the social sciences. My hope is this: it’s getting harder and harder to deny that we have issues as a nation, though I’m sure people are going to try in my comments section. This infection has come to its head in many ways, and it’s not going to go back underground. What, my fellow Americans, do you plan to do about it? Denial isn’t going to work here, and frankly I’m looking forward to our demographics shifting so that I’m not up to my fucking neck in shrill racist dog whistles being given the appearance of being serious political commentary by terrified white people whose informal (and sometimes formal) education is full of bestial PoC who must be managed lest they breed us out of existence, cheat us out of our hard-worked gains, or otherwise contaminate our genes. What are you going to do about it? For myself—I’m going to enjoy voting Trump and his cronies out of office. And I’m going to keep writing these kinds of things because I have no fucking chill and I’m dead tired of this malignant cancer. I will not sit here and pretend the whistles aren’t ringing in my ears. Edited to add:  I think referring people to literature on how racism is disseminated in public and political discourse would help. I’ve also included some material from workshops on dealing with structural racism and articles about the effect of structural racism on policy analysis—I don’t think anyone has a perfect solution, yet, but it’s easier to have an informed discussion in the presence of reading material.

Because if they ALL are, it must be because racism must not be a learned behavior, it must be inherent in the DNA. Which means white people can’t help it. Sounds ridiculous? Of course it does.  Just as ridiculous as saying ALL white people are racist. The statement is intellectually lazy. It also demeans a race…so the statement itself  is racist.  If you substituted any other color, would the statement sound stupid and wrong? Would it sound hateful? Racism is the belief that someone is inferior based on race alone. Seeing as racism is a negative, saying an entire race is operating at a negative makes them inferior.  Which means anybody who says this with any conviction is a racist themselves. Saying that an entire race is keeping you down is announcing YOU are the inferior one because of race being unable to overcome obstacles. Once again, racist. If you live in America, the system was designed to be fair to all. If you aren’t getting the fairness, you have options to shed the light of the law on the problem and get redress…especially these days, when everyone is hyper-aware of the ramifications of the issues of race.

A form of protest at her workplace for her beliefs against the law of the land. Conservative reaction? SHE IS A HERO! She stood up for what she believes​ in. This is America. If we weren't allowed to voice our opinions and thoughts and blindly adhere to the government mechanisms, we'd be living in a tyrrany! FREEDOM FOR THE WIN! Now, explain to me the difference between that protest of Ms. Davis, and this protest: The athletes taking the knee are not disrupting anything, not rioting, not marching on the streets because right wing pundits call that 'A form of violence', not even refusing to do their work, which is to play the sport. They are not protesting the flag or the anthem, they are protesting injustices and systemic racism  through  them. If this is also a wrong way to protest, then what exactly is the right way to do it?

But I also understand that’s largely due to My relatively benign experience is NOT counter-evidence against systemic racism in the police force. The thing is, the majority of people do not experience police brutality. But then again, “do not beat up or kill innocent people” is the bare minimum for any citizen, let alone a police officer, who should, you know, “protect and serve”. OK, say, water. we all drink them, the city provides it, we pay for the water pipes and such with our tax money. But occasionally, some people get serious sickness and die because of bacteria in water. Do you think it is reasonable to say “well, the majority of people have no problem with water, I don’t know why this city’s water services get a bad rap just because a few people died because of drinking water? I don’t understand why are people so angry. So a few of them got seriously ill and died because water service people aren’t careful. And a few of them got seriously ill and died because some water service employees literally poison the water… I have been drinking from the faucet all my life, never had any problem at all.” Your personal experience does not negate systemic problems. And YOU putting your personal experience out there and defend an oppressive system, that makes you part of the problem. You’re basically saying “because I don’t feel oppressed, it does not exist”. You know what that called? It’s called privilege. Yes yes, you’re black, you’re brown, you’re male, you fit the profile. Never experience racism, ever. What is racism, LOL? You got lucky.

Europe varies a lot, it's impossible to generalize racism like that. But it definitely exists, however in a different form than North America. North America tends to have more “malicious” racism, probably due to the history of slavery here. It's often deliberate and systemic. Europe is different. Places like Croatia that have very few black tourists or citizens might seem “racist” at first glance to a black person. Weird stares. Pointing. Laughing. Whispering. Asking to touch your hair or skin. However at a closer look, you realize it's actually just ignorance. Not coming from a place of maliciousness; they just haven't had any experience with black people! It's a great opportunity to spread good will in communities that aren't familiar with us.

The riots, organized by ANTIFA and paid for by George Soros should be between the people who are angry at the way the police behave, and the city managers of the cities they live in. Instead, a man who has said that he wants to see the United States destroyed and who wants to see a revolution here, has mobilized agitators to encourage riots, has supplied them with weapons, and who has paid people to use them against  us! I despise the people who have let this evil into our country, and I would never trust anyone who would “bend a knee”. Americans never “bend a knee”, except to God — and these protestors are not God.

The same is true for all of the -isms and -phobias: racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc… They change the definitions at will to support whatever position they’re trying to take. Thus, they no longer define racism as “treating someone differently based upon their race,” because they’d have to admit that Affirmative Action-like programs are also racist. They’ve added something about “power” to the definition: racism is power plus prejudice. They’ll change that, too, once it no longer supports their positions.

I was part of the dominant group. Because I was part of the dominant group, I never had to worry about racism. Because I never had to worry about racism, I assumed that it was mostly dead, and that whatever remained of it must be either vestigial or, at the very most, the dying embers of a Jim Crow system on its way to its final extinction. When I heard Black Americans complain about racism, it seemed to me that they were whining. Racism was an absurdity. Surely, there couldn’t be very many racists around in the 21st century. Maybe people who complained about it should just shut up and stop making excuses already. If anyone complained of racism, my first reflex was to immediately be skeptical. I wouldn’t confront them, but I would go find 1001 reasons why what had happened wasn’t about racism. Then, I would pat myself on the back for being aloof and rational. Conservative Whites loved me.  Why can’t the other Blacks be more like you, Habib? You’re so reasonable! Like those conservatives, I very much wanted to believe that I lived in a world where racism was dead. Unlike them, however, I was Black. And, sooner or later, I was going to be on the receiving end of racism. And when that happened, I was going to be forced to see what I had been desperately trying not to see. We are the sum of our experiences. I can’t make anyone believe in racism. I know no one else could have made me believe. And, if you don’t believe in White privilege, I’m not even asking you to change your mind. All I ask is that you refrain from telling people that their experiences and perceptions of racism are invalid or unfounded. If I tell someone that I am deciding to boycott a business because I find a certain event racist, I am not asking for permission or validation. And I’m certainly not seeking to debate.

Most people (including Canadians) look at this and say ""Cripes, what is wrong with Americans? They need to fix their bizarre obsession with guns.""

Yes, of course all lives matter. But here’s the thing:  the law enforcement and criminal justice systems act as if black lives matter less than white lives.

Nobody is saying that.  What they are calling attention to is that systemic racism is a serious problem that harms black and minority communities. When people stand up to BLM and say, “no,  all lives matter”  what they are saying is that “you aren’t experiencing any problems which are unique” when in fact, they are. One in fifteen African American men are incarcerated, compared to one in 106 white men. According to the Bureau of Justice, one in three black men will be imprisoned in their lifetime. Black motorists are three times more likely to be searched during traffic stops. Police are four times as likely to use force during encounters with African Americans. The “war on drugs” is largely waged in black and minority communities. When arrested as minors, black youth are more likely to be tried as adults and sent to adult prisons than white kids of the same age. Statistics show that black offenders receive longer sentences and more often are subject to mandatory minimum sentences, and are sentenced to prison terms at disproportionately high rates.

81,As-a-conservative-what-are-your-definitions-of-a-racist-and-what-is-racism,2018-01-28 17:59:51,1174,77,"First off, there are two competing definitions of  race:  the narrow definition, where race refers roughly to what continent your ancestors came from several thousand years ago (blacks from Africa, whites from Europe, Asians from Asia, Native Americans from the Americas, and other terms for smaller or mixed-race groups); and the broad one, which indicates any cultural grouping or ethnicity including skin color, national origin, ancestry, religions, language(s) spoken, cultural expressions of sexual/gender traits, or other statistical clusters from the field of social science. Racism  is mistreatment or injustice against people by race. Sometimes people who advocate for the narrow definition of race as the only definition will nitpick about use of the broad definition. For example, they might say, “Islamophobia is not racism because Muslim is not a race.” They're fishing for people to use some other term like  prejudice  or  arbitrary   discrimination,  but the real answer is that prejudice is prejudice, and the specific type is not a relevant consideration. There's no moral weight to the argument that “This kind of bigotry isn't technically racism.” I'm completely fine with  racism  being accepted as a synonym of  prejudice  except in situations where the distinction carries some specified moral or legal significance, with the burden on the one making the distinction to substantiate the distinction's relevance. I see racism as coming in three forms: All three kinds of racism are undesirable. Base racism provides the motive and intent to generalize and discriminate, generalizations provide a superficial impression of scientific legitimacy to prejudices and institutional racism while hiding logical fallacies and factual errors that built that fascade, and institutional racism can maintain unjust outcomes and arbitrary discrimination even in the absense of any continuing base racism to motivate that harm. The same way that writing a book can help ideas survive even after the writer changes their mind or dies, institutional racism can maintain continuing injustice even after the system's designers die or abandon base racism. Both conservatives and liberals oppose racism, but (speaking very broadly) conservatives tend to prefer narrower definitions of racism and higher standards of proof to demonstrate material injustice. Possibly the narrowest interpretation of racism comes from self-described  race realists,  who argue that solid evidence of statistical difference between the races eliminates the word arbitrary from  arbitrary discrimination,  and turns different treatment by race into a reasonable and just response to scientifically proven differences.  Discrimination,  these race realists have been known to say,  is the knife of reason. I think that race realists make too much of slight differences, often trust poor data, abandon my beloved ideology of individualism in favor of statistical generalization, and generally abuse the scientific method. The vast majority of the racial differences they argue are real are, in fact, the conclusions of poor science, and they will often devolve into unprovable, unfalsifiable conspiracy theories about scientific censorship to justify their trust in fringe and untrustworthy research. They use the technical accuracy of a single truth — there are some differences between the races that can be scientifically proven — to justify vast generalizations and still arbitrary discrimination based on bad science. They can safely denounce base racism and arbitrary discrimination from their philosophical base while, sometimes unintentionally but often intentionally, fighting a battle to make arbitrary discrimination and institutional racism socially acceptable. They will often say, “I'm not a racist, I am a race realist,” but they frequently fail to uphold the high scientific standards necessary to justify that distinction. Many conservatives will argue that a false accusation of “Racist!” is just as bad as actual racism, or that in the quantities we see in modern society that the many accusations of racism have become  more  harmful than actual racism. Usually this is argued from the assumption that only base racism is real, and with the understanding that only the most egregious examples deserve to be called racist. That is two false assumptions. Base racism will always be part of every society, and keeping it marginalized so that races are not mistreated will require constant vigilance. Accusations of racism should be used when approperate, with both overuse and underuse each bringing similar cultural dangers. I see no reason to believe that accusations of racism are the greater problem today. I am a conservative. That means, in part, that I hold a high standard of proof to justify claims generally. I don't easily change my mind in response to the predictions of theory. I need demonstrable consequences already observed in reality to persuade me. I apply those high standards of proof to individual claims of racism and to the broad claim of racism's end in our society. Perhaps unusually among conservatives, I advocate rigorous investigation of our society and our government to locate and eliminate institutional racism, vigorous efforts to see if the high standard of proof can be met. From the Confederates' thwarting of black's civil rights during reconstruction to the modern rise of the alt right and race realism, there are plenty of attempts to establish institutional racism and plenty of evidence of various successes. I demand a very high standard of proof of the claim that institutional racism is no longer a significant factor in modern life, and great energy applied to investigating the question. I am skeptical and critical of affirmative action, as defined as placing intentionally skewed preferences in society with the intent of counteracting existing inequalities. These programs theoretically could improve practical outcomes, but they do little to remove the underlying injustices and inequalities in society. In the same way that boiled (distilled, ionized) water doesn't taste as good as spring water (especially prior to UV deionization), affirmative action layered on top of an unjust system is less palatable than fixing the injustice. I empathize with the need to improve outcomes for minorities, but this approach to the problem seems like a catalyst for backlash, justifying backlash in much of the public imagination. Racism defies the Declaration of Independence's assertion that all men are created equal, and are thereby endowed with certain rights under the law. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution asserts that these rights are to be equal under the law, with no distinctions made by arbitrary criteria. Unless and until the criteria can be shown to be materially relevant, the law's treatment of people must be equal. Violent criminal convicts can be treated as risks of violence based on their individual records, but people with the same parents, skin color, or national origin as a violent convict cannot be treated as violent convicts themselves. They must be treated the same as others in our broad society, since none of those factors are material criteria for determining a material threat. That is my view on racism."
82,What-do-you-think-about-Jordan-Petersons-claim-that-white-privilege-doesnt-exist,2018-05-30 19:23:27,8683,831,"I think he is essentially correct. If the system is geared to give privileges to whites, how come Asians in this country do so well…in fact, better than whites themselves? So maybe it’s NOT skin color that determines your destiny in America. There are so many things that could be classified as privileges like wealth, health, age, and the culture in which you live that can explain why things are as they are. As he stated, to lump a group of people and say this is how all people of this group are, is the direct road to racism. Each person is special and unique, built in with their own privileges. To ignore your own privileges and to link your success or failure to other’s supposed privileges is a cop out."

And I guarantee if someone did, they were told, “No, it’s cute. Leave it.” Racism is systemic.

In Louisiana, the people decided to rename a street after Dr. King. However, there were people against it. Like this guy in the picture. This is what he said… “I’ve never had a racist bone in my body. I’ve worked for a bunch of ’em, been in their houses, been in a lot of your guys’ houses, ” he said. “But if you keep pushing me I will show you my racist ways. [Mayor ] Mitch Landrieu can go to hell. Praise the Lord for Bobby Jindal.” The all white council voted unanimously against the name change… This is just a small look into racism in America. See… Back in the uh..”good” old days of Jim Crow, Black people pretty much ‘stayed in their place’. They did what they were told, and somehow were still terrorized by some bored white people who just liked doing this kind of thing for fun. They hated black people so much just sometimes the sight of them could spark violence. But then… Black people started raising all hell. They were sick and tired of being treated as second class citizens in a country that they fought for too and paid taxes in. How dare they? In 1964, the Civil Rights act was passed and a year later, the Voting Rights Act was passed. I’ve posted this many times as well as a few other great writers before but please pay attention this time. Now look at this timeline and tell me how long Black people have actually had full citizenship in this country? Do you see the areas of red and yellow? Well that was the time where Black people weren’t really allowed to challenge the status quo. This is a time where Whites pretty much did what they wanted to do. They put up offensive statues and memorials without thinking about how Black people would feel about these things. Who would dare speak out? The ones who did were attacked, beaten, and assassinated. Who would sign up for that? But now… Black people are finally speaking up and out and talking about things like police brutality, poor housing, bad schools, racism, prejudiced, systemic racism, everything! But oh no! When we do talk about these things, we get… Everything isn’t always about race! Why you gotta bring race into this? Sometimes, it’s not racial. Jesus, you talk about race all the time, I’m sick and tired of it. Then you get attitudes like the one I posted. Everyone says we need to have a discussion about race, but it obviously is the wrong time because no one really wants to have it! It’s just something people say. No one means it. What they want is for Black people to shut up. But we’ve never done that and we won’t now. Black people are some of the most patriotic people in the country. Why? Because we’ve always held this country accountable for her actions. We’ve always held America to a high standard, the standard that she set for other nations around the world but won’t always live up to it at home. We know this. We fight in wars, pointing our guns in the faces of others around the world and come home to bad schools, bad healthcare, and politicians that don’t care about us. We know these things. So are we causing more racism by speaking up and out? No. We’re doing what we’ve always done. Calling people out on their shit. And that never gets tiring."

I still continue to visit KL occasionally. Here’s what I think. Malaysians love convenience. What that means is they are carriers of borrowed opinions. This means it's much easier for them to borrow opinions in the form of narratives, beliefs, stories, and even news. This plays an important role in the upbringing of families and the education system. This meddled with typical stereotypes gives birth to racism. Malaysia has three races combined that makes Malaysia what it is. The Malays, Chinese and Indians. Generally speaking, all three of these races are inherently and deeply racist from within anyway. We haven’t fought hard enough in this part of the world against racism. We are very protective of our races and not that excited with aliens. The other contributing factor to this is granting citizenship statuses. Asian countries haven’t really flirted with the idea of citizenship much like westerners did. Because flirting with the idea of granting citizenship or naturalization means to also eradicate racism from within. Now this does not mean citizenships were not given but it is not the same as west. Add the religion into its factor and there is a whole different level of added bigotry, racism, xenophobia etc. All three races (Malays, Chinese, Indians) are somewhat religious and conservative with their ancestral identity. Even though Malaysia tries its best to practice religious tolerance, you’ll have to note that majority always overpowers minority. Let’s not forget  Bumiputera law  that protects the Malay race more than Chinese or Indian race only because of their existence. There is no meritocracy in Malaysia. The  Bumiputera law  has damaged more than it protected Malaysia. It sends a message that their are certain people that are privileged simply because they were born in certain race. What sort of privilege is that. Malaysia needs to reform its primary education system as well. You cannot simply have Malay school, Chinese School or Indian School. You need to bring in a law that must integrate all three races and be very strict against racism in school itself. Yes, I have encountered my fair share of racism during my stay in Malaysia but at the same time, I met and befriended some amazing people from Malaysia. Yes, internally, there is a disturbing racist cruelty that exists in Malaysia. They try not to show it but deep down they are effected in someway or another. But at the same time, I have also attended weddings where Indians married Malays, Malays married Indians or Indians married Chinese. Malaysia can do better. Speak up against racism no matter where you see it. To answer  Are Malaysians really as racist and intolerable to one another as the media portrays them to be? No! Not as the media portrays them to be. Media is a bitch. Don’t trust media!"

Yes, blacks and whites are killed committing crimes and resisting arrest. We just had two police officers nearly assassinated in their patrol car by a black man. Now if we had systemic racism police would be rounding up and arresting every black criminal they could. They would be beating them senseless too. Even when protesters were blocking the injured officers from getting medical help, the cops didn’t lose their cool. George Floyd was high as a kite and resisting arrest. There is zero evidence that it was racially motivated and it now looks as if the fentanyl in his system may have killed him. He was also complaining of not being able to breathe before he was ever on the ground. Hands up, dont shoot never happened. Michael Brown attacked a police officer and went back for a second attack when he was shot, multiple witnesses have testified. Eric Gardner had health problems and resisted arrest. His situation was not racially motivated either. He made a mistake by not being compliant and because of his health problems and being overweight, wrestling with police proved fatal. Starting to get the idea? These stories have been presented in a factually inaccurate manner in an effort to make them about race when they aren’t. People are catching on to the games the media is playing and how they have lost all integrity they once had in presenting the news in an unbiased fashion. This is why they have earned the nickname “fake news,” which has stuck!"

So many people are tap-dancing all over the question and even a few justifying the racism. Speaking about paternalistic states and how racism isn’t overt. Seriously? Racism is racism. Let’s not tip over into the absurd, which this conversation has certainly turned into. Of COURSE Rhodesia was a racist state. Anyone saying or believing anything else are deluding themselves. Seriously delusional. …But at Oxford last week, in the civilised ambience of a Union debate, Smith found himself on trial for having failed to learn the lessons of history. Smith said he refused to apologise for atrocities committed while he held office. He said he had no regrets about the estimated 30,000 Zimbabweans killed during his rule. 'The more we killed, the happier we were. We were fighting terrorists.' This is Ian Smith. It’s why white supremacists find a kinship with Rhodesia. It’s why Dylann Roof had the Rhodesian flag on his jacket. I’m watching a white man right now on a video of whites leaving Rhodesia on YouTube. You wouldn’t believe the language he is using for Black people. Confessions of a Recovering Racist | Daily Maverick   Because it was inevitable, that up until then I was a racist. I was born into the white ruling class in racist Rhodesia. My family, our friends, our government – everyone was racist. I went to a white school – the only people of colour I saw were servants.  Racism was not a belief system. For children like me who grew up in that society it was a fact. We were taught that every other race was a lower form of humanity, and the range of derogatory terms covered everyone from Portuguese to Afrikaans, but most especially “black” . As for the rights of Africans in Africa? Hmph! Why was it that only Whites could vote in Rhodesia and a few token blacks? Because majority rules applies in many other countries except for when the majority of people are black. Then that whole thing changes and now it’s MINORITY rule. It’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. You hear most nationalists that say Europe for Europeans, Asia for Asians, but why isn’t Africa for Africans? Why is it okay for a minority group of Europeans to come and live in Africa and rule the entire country? Why is it that Europeans and Americans believe that people should assimilate when immigrants come to their country, except when you come to Africa. Africans should assimilate into EUROPEAN culture on African soil? And no one sees a problem with that. …Makunike’s most daring act as a journalist came in 1970 when he published an editorial after the then Prime Minister Ian Smith had addressed an election meeting at Mt Pleasant Hall near the then University of Rhodesia. It is at this meeting that Mr Smith is said to have remarked that there will be no majority rule in his lifetime. The black students who were part of the students like Witness Mangwende and Simba Makoni responded by walking out singing “Ishe Komborera Africa”. In response, Smith and his cabal of white supporters sang a racist white South African song normally sung at rugby matches titled “Bobbejaan Klim die Berg,” which means “The Baboon Climbs the Mountain”. Yeah. There’s no racism there at all. Like at all. Well, other than the song, “The Baboon Climbs the Mountain.” And the fact that Smith was an unapologetic racist. Rhodesia ran on racist ideology and views. Putting the natives “in their place” not allowing them to even have a say in their own country simply based on the color of their skin. What else could Rhodesia be, with its history and its practice of treating the native Blacks terribly? A racist state. When people defend Rhodesia, they are defending racism, colonialism, and White supremacy. That’s what Rhodesia was."

Whenever you are a minority, you are likely to be the subject of racism, and in some places white people are the minority. I’ve always lived in countries where the population is predominantly white, so I haven’t experienced it myself—but other people have told me their experiences. In particular, many Chinese people have admitted that their countrymen are very racist against whites. A friend of my son’s grew up in a remote part of Australia that was mainly occupied by indigenous Australians. Her family moved to the area for her father’s job when she was a young child, and she and her siblings were the only white children at the local school. As a pretty, blonde blue-eyed girl, her experience there was horrible. She was regularly bullied: called names, had stones thrown at her, and was kicked and punched. She and her siblings were particularly taunted for their skin and hair colour. Even when the majority of a country’s population is white, it’s not impossible for whites to experience racism. I once saw a disgusting online argument in which a group of Lebanese Australians and a group of Australians of British background were hurling abuse at each other. Both groups were incredibly vicious, and most of the insults were based on race. I would contend that both sides in that argument were racist—however, I have had conversations with people who claim that racism against white people simply doesn’t exist. When non-whites post on social media that they want to kill white people simply because of the colour of their skin, that’s racism. And it’s not “reverse racism”, as some people like to call it. It’s racism, pure and simple. Because there is so much systemic racism against non-whites, sometimes we lose sight of the big picture. Racism against  anyone— black, brown or white — is evil.

97,What-does-racism-mean-in-the-21st-century,2020-04-25 04:16:22,9560,688,"There was a patient I remember from my second year of training. He was a white man in his mid 60s who had been assigned to one of the residents in the program. A day or two after his admission, the resident almost got into trouble. It looked like the patient’s housekeeper or personal assistant had brought him some clothes and other items from home. Before the young doctor could comment on how nice and convenient it must be to have such help, it became clear that the “personal assistant” was in fact the patient’s wife! Why did the resident assume that she must be hired help, then? Because she was black. Was this racism? Many will wonder why I’m even bringing race into this. Maybe the doctor had noticed that this couple wasn’t as affectionate as other couples. Or maybe it was the way she was dressed. Or maybe she looked younger than his wife could have been expected to be. Maybe I’m just projecting my own insecurities onto the mind of an innocent former colleague. But here’s the deal: the doctor in question never denied that it was about race, and clearly felt bad about it. So, I ask again, was this doctor racist? In most societies, the status of wife carries a higher social standing than that of hired help. The assumption wasn’t that this woman was a friend or a very solicitous boss. It was that she was a housekeeper. Sure, black-man-white-woman couplings are more common than white-man-black-woman ones. So maybe we can give the poor doc a pass. But still, this is pretty bad, right? Isn’t assuming that someone is less than what they are based on nothing more than the color of their skin a textbook example of racism? Does racism have to involve malice? Does racism have to involve institutional power? Even if that’s the case, can it not be said that physicians have some measure of power over patients and their family members? There is another angle that should be explored. When we say that someone did something racist, or that someone is a racist, what do we mean? Is the world divided between racists and non racists? Is racism a permanent character flaw, an indelible scarlet letter to be worn in perpetuity, or at least until expiation has been demonstrated to enough of an extent to earn absolution? Or is it just one more form of groupism we all slip in an out of, with varying degrees of self-awareness? Would it change your mind or confirm your opinion if I were to tell you that my colleague was a white woman? But what if I told you instead that, as was indeed the case, I was actually the doctor in that story. Was I racist against that woman? Am I a racist? And if not, are you merely absolving me because of the color of my skin? This is what it means to discuss racism in the 21st century. At the aggregate or institutional level, it’s possible to see data showing how the application of the criminal code varies based on the race. This is true whether you look at who is more likely to be arrested for a given type of crime, who is more likely to have a pretrial detention, who is more likely to be sentenced for drug offenses, who is more likely to benefit from discretionary release on parole, and who is more likely to be disenfranchised following incarceration. But at the individual level, it’s very hard to know for certain when an action is motivated by racism. The in-your-face, hostile racism of old is largely dead. We have defeated it. Even racists don’t want to be perceived as such. So what remains in face-to-face interactions is a lot more subtle. It’s a set of unavowed, unexamined, and often unconscious biases. It’s a lack of comfort with a perceived other that leads to an avoidance of all but the most superficial forms of social intercourse. It is also, occasionally, a benevolent paternalism that makes excuses for indefensible behavior if the perpetrator happens to be of a group seen as deserving special care and tenderness. That said, overall, I’m an optimist. It’s hard to see progress when you look at increments of 5 or even 10 years. But when you look at how far we’ve come since the mid 90s, and how much better things were in 1995 than they had been in 1970, it’s hard not to see a world in which racism is slowly being defeated."
