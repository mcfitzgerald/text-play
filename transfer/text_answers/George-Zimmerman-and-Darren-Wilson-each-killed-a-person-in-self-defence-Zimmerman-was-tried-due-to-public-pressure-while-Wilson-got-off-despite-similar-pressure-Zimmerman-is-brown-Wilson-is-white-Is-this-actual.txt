The premise is false. Zimmerman was tried in accordance with law. Wilson was investigated by the Ferguson Police, the St. Louis Police (as an impartial investigation), and the Department of Justice. Both were found innocent of wrongdoing. Wilson actually went through more scrutiny, as he was a law enforcement officer. If this was evidence of systemic racism, then it would be racism against whites. Both men got their day in court, were found not guilty due to preponderance of the evidence, and exonerated. No racism here.
