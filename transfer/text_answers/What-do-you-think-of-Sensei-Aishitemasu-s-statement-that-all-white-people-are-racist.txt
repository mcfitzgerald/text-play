If ALL white people are racist, what are the rest of you bitching for? Because if they ALL are, it must be because racism must not be a learned behavior, it must be inherent in the DNA. Which means white people can’t help it. Sounds ridiculous? Of course it does.  Just as ridiculous as saying ALL white people are racist. The statement is intellectually lazy. It also demeans a race…so the statement itself  is racist.  If you substituted any other color, would the statement sound stupid and wrong? Would it sound hateful? Racism is the belief that someone is inferior based on race alone. Seeing as racism is a negative, saying an entire race is operating at a negative makes them inferior.  Which means anybody who says this with any conviction is a racist themselves. Saying that an entire race is keeping you down is announcing YOU are the inferior one because of race being unable to overcome obstacles. Once again, racist. If you live in America, the system was designed to be fair to all. If you aren’t getting the fairness, you have options to shed the light of the law on the problem and get redress…especially these days, when everyone is hyper-aware of the ramifications of the issues of race. MLK Jr. talked about content of character over color of skin. This statement takes his dream and pushes it back.
