Hello, Mr. or Ms. Anonymous, I'm so surprised you asked this question anonymously. This was a triumph of insightful, incisive interrogation. I'm being so sincere right now. In the US, Black people are far more likely to receive prison sentences for crimes than white people convicted of the same crimes under similar circumstances. Black people are less likely to be hired than equally qualified white people. Several studies have demonstrated this by taking  word for word identical  resumes, attaching a “black sounding” or “white sounding” name, and sending them to employers. Resumes with white-sounding names receive far more callbacks than identical resumes with black-sounding names. Same for apartment applications. Same for mortgage applications. Black people are far more likely to be shot by police for non-violent infractions. Police who shoot unarmed Black people are far less likely to face any consequences than police who shoot unarmed whites. If you look at the objective evidence, the points of data make a beautiful line squarely in the direction of systemic racism, though of course, it isn't racism that is of interest to those who ask questions such as this.
