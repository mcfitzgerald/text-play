Take out the racism and National Socialism is basically Fascism. Fascism as a system of governance works very efficiently and brings economic prosperity, but it also brings a loss of civil liberties and the ability to choose and change oneâ€™s government. So it depends on your perspective. The running joke in the Fascist/NS countries during the interwar years was that at least there was no longer freedom to starve.
