Because it is not about Trump. It is never about Trump. It is about the anger, fear, and resentment from the people who felt that they’re being wronged and ignored. Trump is not a leader, Trump and his cohort (the republican house representatives and senators, and the conservative media) are enablers. Trump didn’t create anything new. The rage and contempt were already there. Trump simply told them “It’s OK to let it out”. And our system (politicians and police force) told them “there won’t be any consequences”. That’s why these people praised Trump for “telling it as it is”. Because it means they get to express their racism and bigotry freely without consequences. That’s why it doesn’t matter what Trump did, doesn’t matter how outrageous it was, these people do not care. I’m willing to go even further to say that Trump supporters didn’t care about Trump as a person. They care about what Trump and his cohort allows them to do. If tomorrow Trump has a stroke and dies, these people will promote the same hatred and violence fueled by their anger and fear. So no. The problem isn’t Trump. The problem is our system, and how it lets people like Trump get away with things. It is our system that, through racism in education, racism in our culture, created generation after generation of people who believe in an “us vs them” mentality, who believes in “wealth = virtue” and who worship wealthy people… So no. These people won’t feel like they’re being “sold out” by Trump. Trump has become more and more irrelevant. Soon they’ll find some other racist asshat to worship. What really scary is when they find a machiavellian smart asshat to worship. Someone who is at good as flaming hatred as Trump, and someone with an actual agenda, and an actual ideology, someone who is smart and determined enough to do something with that hate. Then we’d be screwed.
