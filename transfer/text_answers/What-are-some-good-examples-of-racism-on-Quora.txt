I had no idea that racism was such a big problem in the Indian subcontinent before I joined Quora. I knew there was a lot of colourism  here. But racism? I thought it was just a problem of the West. On Quora, I came across  some  really racist Indians, Pakistanis, and in particular Kashmiris. I saw answers that try to prove that the whole human civilization originated in India. The answers of these sort end up justifying caste system and tell you that Brahmans are the  real Aryans  of the world. The purest race. I saw commenters who commented how all the Indians have filth in their DNA and are “filthy Aryans mixed with Dravidians.” A few self proclaimed  genealogy experts  proved Kashmiris are Europeans and all the others in the subcontinent are dirty mixed race. The level of racism some of the answers here contain is mind-numbing. I will give credit to the Quora moderation. They remove this venom from the Quora’s system as soon as possible. So I can’t show you all the wretched opinions I have come across. I don’t just have a good (bad?) example but the best (worst?) example of them all. Thanks to  . (Should I be thankful?) He found a racist troll who he talks about in his post, here.  See for yourself: Translation ahahaha Black daughter of a swine. [Source:  ] How can one paragraph contain so many misconceptions and racist speculations? [Source:  ] The Quora moderation acts quickly but it still needs to be faster than it is right now to tackle these toxic trolls. (  I hope it doesn't collapse my answer though. That would be quite ironic. )
