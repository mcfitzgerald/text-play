First, I want to check the dictionary to make sure I’m using “institutional racism” correctly: Ok. In that case, my answer fits the definition perfectly: The best public high schools in Chicago are called “selective enrollment” schools, because they do exactly that… selectively enroll students on a point system. Students are divided into four “tiers” based on the average income of the people on their block. The selective enrollment schools only take a certain number of students from each tier. Here is a map of the “tiers.” The green areas of the map are “tier 4” neighborhoods. The red areas are “tier 1” neighborhoods. Here are the scores needed to get into one of the best selective enrollment high schools in Chicago: A 900 is the best possible score. A student from a tier 4 neighborhood had to score 889 out of 900 to get into this school, but a student from a tier 1 neighborhood only had to score an 816 to get in. So that’s the “institutional” part. Now let’s look at the “racism” part. Here’s a map of Chicago demographics: If you were to overlay those two maps, you’d see an almost perfect correlation between CPS tier ranking and predominant race on the block. That’s an institution (Chicago Public Schools) using a metric to judge students that is de facto race-based. That is institutional racism. Before the tier system was established, it actually was completely based on race. But they got sued and changed it to “socio-economic status” which, in Chicago, aligns heavily with race. Yes, I know, the reason socio-economic status aligns with race in Chicago is because of generations of institutional racism in the past. The city is using this new institutional racism to try and correct the institutional racism of the past. I get it. I’m not even saying it’s wrong. I know why they do it. I’m just saying that it’s a textbook example of institutional racism: an organization that treats people from different races differently, and it’s considered normal and rarely questioned.
