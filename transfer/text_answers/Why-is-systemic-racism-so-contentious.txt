Because of the Civil Rights Act, any racism in a system would be weeded out. That means any racism that is done within the system is individual or group racism, not systemic. If one police department is racist, that doesn’t mean all police departments are. There are no laws that specifically apply to one race and not another. Therefore, while systemic racism used to exist, it no longer does. Some people don’t grasp that concept.
