Here’s the  top chart   , and you have a surprise winner. Even I was shocked to see the result. What the hell has happened to India the great melting pot? What have we done to India! Centuries of polarisation and hate-mongering of communally and ethnically oriented politics obviously did not do India any good. India has stopped being a large sack of different grains. It now have many small purses of identical grains within that sack. Each purse hating the next one. A brilliant way to pull a nation down. That’s exactly what South Africa is going through. P.S. Bangladesh, my own country, is no less racist than India. But, the survey, unfortunately covered only 61 countries, and did not include us. The only difference would be absence of someone to be racist against. You see, 90% of people in Bangladesh are Bengali-speaking Sunni Muslims coming from the same pool of genetic mix. Have you noticed that 13 countries in the top 18 are Muslim countries? Sad.
