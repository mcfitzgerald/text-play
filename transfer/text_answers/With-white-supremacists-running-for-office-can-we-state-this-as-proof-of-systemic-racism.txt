“With gangs shooting people in Compton, can we state this as proof that black people are evil?” “With that Asian driver that cut me off the other day, can we state this as proof that Asians’ eyes are too small for driving properly?” “With the number of Taco Bell locations opening up in the USA, can we state this as proof that Mexicans are inundating this country?” No? Then why the hell would you even ask this question? Pretty much anyone born in America over the age of 35 with a clean record can run for president. Even if a blatant racist (let’s ignore Trump for now, as it’s a long winded debate) became POTUS, it would  still  have nothing to do with systemic racism. You know what is systemic racism? Slavery. Jim Crow Laws. Japanese Internment Camps. Those were systemically racist policies. If you show me a law or public policy that is inherently  racist , I will fight it with you. I abhor racism. But you can’t just point to a vague idea that is irrelevent and arguably false altogether, and expect me to take you seriously.
