That’s the weird thing about racism…it knows no color. The only ingredient for racism is at least two people of different races and a hateful attitude by one. Any skin tone can be racist. Not having systemic power doesn’t excuse hateful acts to another race. You can be racist and have no power at all. The answer to your question is YES.
