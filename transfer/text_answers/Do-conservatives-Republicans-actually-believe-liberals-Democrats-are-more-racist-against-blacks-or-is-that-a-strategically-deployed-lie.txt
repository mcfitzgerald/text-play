“Do conservatives/Republicans actually believe liberals/Democrats are more racist against blacks, or is that a strategically deployed lie?” Zarrella-Fact rates this claim… Half-True. If we’re talking specifically about racism  against blacks  rather than all forms of racism, then it is undeniable that the lion’s share of  overt  racists are Republican (or at least more likely to vote GOP, regardless of  official  party affiliation). That is, there aren’t many Democratic Klansmen or any of the other sorts who would overtly and consciously speak against “n*gg*rs” or talk about how blacks need to “learn their place” or whatever. However, there are two forms of racism that are  vastly  more prevalent among Democrats and/or other progressives: And yes, I would argue that the latter two forms of racism are  worse  than whatever overt racism or implicit bias infects conservatism—because the latter two are  insidious : they make many blacks  collaborators  in their own discrimination. I do want to make one more effort at clarity, however, because of the highly charged nature of the subject matter: When I say, “X form of racism is [most common in / exclusive to] progressivism,” I  do not mean  that all or most progressives are guilty of it. I mean only that all or most people who  are  guilty of it are progressives. Just as I said at the outset— most  conservatives are not overt racists, but  most  overt racists are conservatives (at least in terms of the colloquial political spectrum—whether they are “conservatives” in a proper political philosophy sense is a more complicated question).
