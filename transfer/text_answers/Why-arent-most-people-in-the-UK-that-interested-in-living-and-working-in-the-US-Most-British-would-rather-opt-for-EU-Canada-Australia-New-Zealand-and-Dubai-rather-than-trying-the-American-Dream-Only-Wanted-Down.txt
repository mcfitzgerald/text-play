As someone who once wanted to live in the US, here are the reasons I no longer want to: The US doesn’t have public healthcare. The US has very few workers’ rights. There is no religious freedom in much of the US - unless you’re a Protestant Christian. Your TV has far too many adverts in it. Your local law enforcement system is broken and racist. Your courts system is dysfunctional. School shootings. Systemic racism. Dysfunctional Congress holding kleptocrats and collaborators with autocrats and proto-fascists. ICE. Trump. (BTW - if you're an American and offended by this: tough.)
