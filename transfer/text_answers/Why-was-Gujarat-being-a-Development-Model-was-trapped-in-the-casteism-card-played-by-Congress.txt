There is a completely nonsensical notion we have that development is an antidote to casteism. It is not. Japan is a highly developed, rich society. But, has a huge level of hierarchies and closed mentality. Their economic development is little related with their social attitudes. US is the richest country on earth. And it is rife with racism and other biases. In Indiaâ€™s own case, Kerala is highly educated with high HDI numbers, but still caste system is extremely strong there. A rich person may not be less casteist than a poor person. An educated person may not be less biased than an uneducated person. Just that rich, educated people have better cover for their biases and have better communication skills. In fact, many rich, educated people find comfort in casteism. Caste becomes an easy way for them to understand why they are successful while others are not. They might find comfort in the networks provided by castes. And they might find comfort in the identity provided by the castes. Our generation is undoubtedly richer than our previous generations. But, we are not necessarily less casteist. Just that many of us grow to not fully express or visualize the caste system as we grow up. Gujarat can be both developed and casteist. And so can be every other state.
