It’s a misconception that white people don’t face racism. Whenever you are a minority, you are likely to be the subject of racism, and in some places white people are the minority. I’ve always lived in countries where the population is predominantly white, so I haven’t experienced it myself—but other people have told me their experiences. In particular, many Chinese people have admitted that their countrymen are very racist against whites. A friend of my son’s grew up in a remote part of Australia that was mainly occupied by indigenous Australians. Her family moved to the area for her father’s job when she was a young child, and she and her siblings were the only white children at the local school. As a pretty, blonde blue-eyed girl, her experience there was horrible. She was regularly bullied: called names, had stones thrown at her, and was kicked and punched. She and her siblings were particularly taunted for their skin and hair colour. Even when the majority of a country’s population is white, it’s not impossible for whites to experience racism. I once saw a disgusting online argument in which a group of Lebanese Australians and a group of Australians of British background were hurling abuse at each other. Both groups were incredibly vicious, and most of the insults were based on race. I would contend that both sides in that argument were racist—however, I have had conversations with people who claim that racism against white people simply doesn’t exist. When non-whites post on social media that they want to kill white people simply because of the colour of their skin, that’s racism. And it’s not “reverse racism”, as some people like to call it. It’s racism, pure and simple. Because there is so much systemic racism against non-whites, sometimes we lose sight of the big picture. Racism against  anyone— black, brown or white — is evil.
