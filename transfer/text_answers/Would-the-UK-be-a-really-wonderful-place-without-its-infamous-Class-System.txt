Living in Hong Kong was a big eye opener for me. On this basis I concluded that I was right to think what I previous thought, which was: Hong Kong society on the other hand, has a much more hierarchical class system than Britain. It also discriminates, entirely unflinchingly, on the basis of race. What’s more, it’s utterly un-selfconscious about both. Its racial and class hierarchy is explicit, universally acknowledged, and entirely unapologetic. I spoke to a Japanese friend about this, who was asking me about my reflections on life in Hong Kong. I said, the first thing everyone wanted to know was, “what race are you?” She told me “all Asian countries are like that. The idea that your race doesn’t matter is a Western idea. It doesn’t exist in Asia”. The second thing they wanted to know was “how much money do you have?” She told me “that’s peculiarly Hong Kong”. Britain is probably the most stridently egalitarian and class-structure-lacking countries I’ve ever seen. Yet the peculiar thing is, it still obsesses over itself, as if it has a class structure. I’ve come to the conclusion over the years, that Britain’s relationship with the idea of a “class structure” is a peculiar and complex one. It’s more about what people think other people think, than what those mythical “other” people actually do think. Would Britain be a really wonderful place without its “infamous” class system? Well, my answer to this is, it is a really wonderful place and it doesn’t have much of a class system.
