People who “taint the entire police force as racists” are making an error. Most people aren’t saying that, though. We’re saying that there is  systemic racism in the justice system, and particularly in the police . That  doesn’t  mean “all police are racist”. Quite the contrary, it means that the system is designed so there are incentives that tend to produce racist  outcomes  even when many people working in the system are not intentionally racist.
