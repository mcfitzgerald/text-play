Do you believe the new charges for Minneapolis former officers were influenced by protests? Why or why not? Absolutely. I think that without public outrage the murderer would have been silently fired and the whole thing would have been swept under the rug. He would never have been prosecuted without the protests. The reason is systemic racism. Black people are oppressed and people who harm them are taken out of the firing line instead of being held accountable. Unless the public makes it unmistakably clear that that kind of “solution” is not an option.
