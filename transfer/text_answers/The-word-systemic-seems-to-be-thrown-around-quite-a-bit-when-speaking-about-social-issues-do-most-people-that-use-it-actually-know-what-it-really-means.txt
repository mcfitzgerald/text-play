I listen to a lot of Progressive talk radio. From what I’ve heard to most of the hosts and callers, “systemic” has a very malleable definition that they change to fit their narrative needs at the time. The same is true for all of the -isms and -phobias: racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc… They change the definitions at will to support whatever position they’re trying to take. Thus, they no longer define racism as “treating someone differently based upon their race,” because they’d have to admit that Affirmative Action-like programs are also racist. They’ve added something about “power” to the definition: racism is power plus prejudice. They’ll change that, too, once it no longer supports their positions. Once you realize that there’s no pleasing the Progressives, so you just quit trying, you’ll save yourself a lot of stress.
