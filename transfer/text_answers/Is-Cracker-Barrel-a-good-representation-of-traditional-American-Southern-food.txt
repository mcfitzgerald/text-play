In some ways, Cracker Barrel is the perfect representation of the American South. Not in its food. Its food is fair to mid grade diner food, typical of diners from New York to California, dressed up in down-home aww-shucks faux-southern language on the menu. I doubt anyone,  especially  folks who live in the American south, would call it true southern food. The way in which Cracker Barrel is quintessentially American south is a long history of entrenched racism. For years, Cracker Barrels had two dining rooms, one hidden behind a screen, and would seat non-white customers and white customers who looked weird in the screened dining room. (I and a group of friends stopped at Cracker Barrel on our way from DragonCon in Atlanta. We were wearing con clothes, and got seated in the undesirables room.) This practice was so pervasive—it was documented at scores of restaurants in seven states—that in 2001 Cracker Barrel settled a large-scale Federal lawsuit over systemic racism…and then in 2004 settled  another  Federal lawsuit over continuing systemic racism. In 2009 Cracker Barrel settled another Federal lawsuit saying that managers and other employees regularly groped, fondled, and harassed female employees. Then in 2017 it settled  another  Federal lawsuit, this one over violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. When I lived in Georgia, I and some of the folks I know regularly referred to Cracker Barrel as “Cracker Bigot.”
