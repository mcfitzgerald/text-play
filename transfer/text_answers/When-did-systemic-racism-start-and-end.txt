People act like systemic racism has a start and end date, like “started at 1:00 pm on 12/23/1645 and ended on 4/1/1965.” Systemic racism has ebbs and flows in society’s history. In America, systemic racism gradually came into being with the settlement of the New World, and it’s decline started with the Civil Rights Act. Systemic racism has become so rare in America that most racism is anecdotal. There is no definitive start and stop time.
