As I understand it, it means that past racism has influenced the way the system is set up, so that racism continues to have ongoing influence even when people are not being intentionally racist. For example, up until the 1960s it was perfectly legal, and common, for black people to be barred from buying houses in nice areas even if they could afford to live there, so they were corralled into poor areas which were then provided with poor schools. That has a long-term knock-on effect, because people who are 30 now have parents who went to those poor schools and lived in those poor areas, and many still *are* stuck in poor areas because they didnâ€™t inherit a nice house from their parents - it takes a while for families and communities to catch up on that initial shortfall.
