0,Can I use Comet and bleach to clean my bathroom,"You can use both but not at the same time. Comet is an abrasive cleanser and is best used for removing soap scum, hard water deposits, and mold and mildew and the stains they leave behind. Rinse well when you are done and send the removed crud and gritty residue left from the Comet or a similar cleanser down the drain. Bleach, either chlorine or oxygen, is good for removing stains on clothing and hard household surfaces, and bleach also sanitizes. In the proper concentration and if allowed to stay on a surface long enough, it will kill pretty much everything, bacteria, fungi, molds, and viruses. Just be sure to dilute chlorine bleach with water. For cleaning surfaces a 10 bleach solution works best, and never use straight chlorine bleach, and make sure the area you are cleaning is well ventilated. Chlorine fumes are very irritating to eyes and prolonged exposure can cause permanent damage, as can inhaled fumes to the lungs. Remember that the more concentrated the bleach is, and the longer you are exposed, the more damage will occur. IMPORTANT WARNING chlorine intended for household bleach is between 5 and 8 percent concentration, and is not all bleach.

Ive used mine for about a year through some intense hot yoga classes and still feels brand new, if anything just more broken in. Pros The sweatier you get, the more grip you get. Eco friendly Anti microbial self cleaning Super lightweight The company is great, family oriented. Cons Grip isnt very good if the mat is dry. Decent price for what youre getting at 120, but still pricey if you ask me. The Liforme Yoga Mat Ideal for any style. Ive had mine for over a year, use it all the time for nonheated classes just my preference and when I teach. Pros great grip, wet or dry Helpful lines for alignment Not heavy Eco friendly Comes with a carrying case Cons pricey at 140 Too much sweat tends to puddle Too much sweat can make you slip Harmony Mat Ideal for any style, but depends on how much you sweat. Had mine for about a year, using it ALL the time for mostly home practice, only minor signs of any wear and tear. Pros nice grip Eco friendly Lightweight Super cheap at 80 Cons short life 3 years on average, depending on your practice Too much sweat will definitely make you slip Note Ive not included Manduka because my experience with them has been pretty terrible and quite dangerous as far as slipping is concerned. Ive tried their pro series and their new mat that was designed for a better grip and still no luck. This is after numerous salt methods as well, so I dont recommend them if your problem is slipping on your mat. Thats it Ive had great luck with these 3 mats, depending on where I use them, but thats just my experience. Im interested to see what others have to say. Good luck What is the best yoga mat for sweaty hands? Can you use Clorox wipes on yoga mats?"
4,How do you get white stains water out of light colored marble counters,"Ok, I m not a chemist, but I have done a lot of clean up. The white stains are from minerals in the water. Don't use a cleanser like Comet, or anything abrasive. I've always used a cleaner called TriSodiumPhospate TSP. It dissolves in water, and cleans most anything. It's user friendly, no gloves needed. There's another product called Goof Off don't laugh, it's the name of the stuff. It comes in a liquid or spray.don't need gloves for it either. Tip any time you clean any counter top, use a nylon scrub pad, and don't bare down on it. If you do, your creating a hollowed out spot, where stuff can set in and grow. Big no no.

How can hardwater or watersoftener salt stains be removed from glazed ceramic tile and from satinnickel fixtures? How do I clean up stains on ceramic tiles? How do I clean deep rooted stains from cultured marble showers? If you are looking for an exact brand, I can agree with  StoneTechs socalled BulletProof sealer would be perfect for protecting your countertop from oil and water stains because of its fluoropolymers. What these compounds do is that it prevents the surface from absorbing water, and the sealer itself even seeps through the surface to also keep oil spills at bay effectively. You can also check out the Black Diamond Stoneworks Granite Sealer if the finish of your granite countertop is on the shiny side. If your countertop needs to maintain its luster, stains from water and oil will surely affect the surfaces look. This product is as effective as the one I mentioned earlier and is also easy to apply since it distributes evenly. You can check out a lot of brands in the market, depending on what type of granite countertop you have. Some will take longer before requiring a resealing, while some may last for 6 months only. At the same time, theres no harm in spending a bit more on getting premium penetrating sealers like the ones I have mentioned. The investment is worth it, considering they also protect against oils, and some can even enhance the color and patterns of your stone to make your countertop look more vibrant. And of course, there are different types of granites. Make sure to do the water test first by measuring how long the surface forms a dark stain from the water. Your countertop might not be as porous and can handle most spills. Still, I think putting a sealer on appropriate intervals will keep your countertop looking gorgeous and working for a long time. Which is the best granite sealer for a kitchen counter top against oil and water stains? Yeah. I know your problem. If you purchased relatively cheap granite it was probably not well sealed. As you did your usual work on the counter the sealer was compromised and the water soaked into the granite. Granite is very porous. So, what you are seeing is mineral stains from after the water evaporated. I regret to say that removing them is extremely difficult to impossible BUT you can do something to reduce the possibility of it happening again. It takes effort and is stinky and mildly costly. First, clean the counter with ammonia. Plain ammonia, nothing with additives or scents. Allow to dry. If there is any caulk this will have to be removed first. Using a FINE Scotchbrite pad do not use steel wool scuff the surface down until all the gloss is gone. Using a foam roller apply  Granite countertops look cool but they are certainly not maintenancefree. Why am I getting water stains on my granite kitchen counters? More importantly, perhaps is how to clean or even prevent them? Did you do the acetone part? That's important. Baking soda doesn't do much but to hold onto the water. It has little to no effect on the oil. Water can draw out acetone. And acetone draws out oil. I had food coloring sink into my countertop. I was successful by wetting a paper towel and placing weight on it to push it onto the surface. The food coloring seeped into the water of the paper towel and that removed it. I feel this should be similar. Acetone should dissolve the oils and then you pull out the acetone. I personally would soak a cotton ball or paper towel in 90something rubbing alcohol or acetone and compress it onto the table and leave it there in such a way to keep the cloth from drying out too quickly. Check it in 20 minutes and see if it's gotten any better. Let me know how it goes if you try it. I treated an oil stain on marble with baking soda, and it just made the stain bigger. What do I do now? How do you get white stains water out of lightcolored marble counters?"

Im very nervous because I dont want to harm any birds that eat this, what should I do? It is important to keep your feeders clean because birds can get sick from moldy seeds.

They used the herb  Codex Florentino also describes a series of toothpastes they used to clean their teeth and herbs to treat oral diseases.  ,  They didnt have garbage dumps. Instead they developed a system of recycling, burning some materials such as used garments, which were used to light the streets at night, and disposing of the remainder in their chinampas floating gardens as fertilizers. Is it true that the Aztecs took great care of their hygiene and daily swept and cleaned the streets of Tenochtitlan? People in ancient culturesSumerians, Minoans, Incas, Aztecs etc, must have had ordinary personal possessions that didn't end up buried under ruins.

I happen to be partial to Galvanize, but wholly concur with Robertos advice. nBoth Metis and Galvanize run highly respected programs and it really comes down to what is right for you. Here are  1. Who else is the program admitting? A welldesigned program will require an application, skill evaluation and interviews, to ensure that every student is set up to succeed in the program. If a bootcamp is ready to take your credit card number without any questions upfront, theyre more interested in their bottom line than in your education. 2. How do they calculate their placement numbers? Sure, 99 placements rate sounds good, but whats really behind that number? Skyhigh placement percentages can be meaningless, depending on how theyre calculated. Theres no standard industry definition of employed  does it include graduates who got a job unrelated to their new field? Lessthanideal freelance and parttime gigs? Dig into the data. After all, youre on your way to becoming a data scientist 3. How long does the program last? Start a new career in tech in six weeks Sounds too good to be true, and thats probably because it is. Coding,  4. Outside of class, what does this program offer? Will your bootcamp send you off with nothing more than a certificate and a pat on the back? The right program doesnt just offer training, it provides the connections for you to break into your new field. Whether its hiring events, access to a network of industry heavyhitters or ongoing assistance with your resume, applications and interviews, the best bootcamps offer a range of resources to get you hired. Beyond career services, what does your campus offer? Will you be stuck in a windowless cube all day, or surrounded by people eager to innovate and collaborate? While some bootcamps cultivate a community of likeminded learners, other leave you adrift on your own. Try to get a sense of the daytoday before you commit to spending six months on campus  its worth the research.

But if you are expecting something else to effectively get rid of the discoloration from UV exposure, dont hold your breath.

If you were to pay for it, you would make sure that you were only charged a reasonable amount of money for the service, and make sure that it was done right. As part of your due diligence, you would visit your mother once a month at least to make sure that the cleaning service did their job properly. If your mother wont accept you taking charge of her cleaning issue, then you can have her take you out to lunch when you visit her.

How do I deal with my demanding elderly mother who insists on staying in her home but can no longer take care of things? What if my mom treats me like a maid? She tells me to clean the house all by myself, and tells me to clean my brothers room since its a mess . All she does is clean the dishes and barely cooks. I'm only 14 Not sure if this helps, but I am a single mother of 2 children and rent is my top priority. Keeping a roof over my childrens heads is first and foremost I has rented the same property for several years and had never missed or been late in any rental I've ever occupied. About two years ago my previous landlord made the choice to sell the property and the new buyer took ownership. About 1 year later with the new landlord my car broke down and it was going to cost more than I had to fix it, without my car I would have lost my job. I contacted every service provider to explain that payments would be late and set up instalment plans and gathered every resource I could muster, but was still just a little short. Eventually I swallowed my pride and contacted my landlord and told them of my situation to see if I could change schedules without messing up rent or getting behind. They told me they would give me two weeks grace without late payment fee, but also very patiently and sensitivity let me know it would put them in a tighter situation as they where paying a mortgage on the property. I fixed my car, got back to work, but had the horrible feeling of impending doom of how I could possibly catch up on everything, bearing in mind that rent was my first priority to catch up. Now Im not entirely sure what went through my landlords minds, but two days after I caught up on my rent which I did within a week, rather than the two they gave me I received a handdelivered letter in the mail. This letter was from my new landlords and contained a 100 gift card inside a Christmas card, that just said thanks for being such a great tenant, warm regards, your landlords. Now as an Australian that's not as much for where your from, but that money went straight on food which eased the burden of getting back on track and keep rent up to date, that one act of kindness gave me enough of a break to catch up and keep on track. Mind you when the time came to move out recently, the act of kindness was returned when they wanted to move into the property as they aren't investors, but wanted to sell their old house and eventually live in the property. On my departure because of their kindness I spoke to their realtor and found out their favorite bottle of wine and purchased it with 2 of the nicest wine glasses I could find, cleaned the property with every fibre of my being and left their gift with a thank you card on the counter and handed the keys over. Long story short, if your tenant is good and rent gets paid, be kind. While I'm not telling you to reward late payments, sometimes if a tenant understands you have bills to pay too and if youre so inclined, think of a way to help the situation rather than adding more debt, you can walk out very happy.

My mom asked me to move in and save her house. I did and have been cleaning up. Now, she is telling me she is about 10,000 behind. I'm thinking we can be evicted at any moment. Should I give up on the house and move out? My brother and I told our mom that we would help her to stay in her own home, until it started causing problems in our lives. This may sound selfish on our part to some people. We both lived several hours from our mom. She would not consider moving closer to us when dad died. She was quite adamant about not giving up anything in her life to compensate for her health and money issues. We enabled her to stay independent by assisting with bill paying, providing maintenance on the house, lawn care, and we alternated going to see her 2 times a week each. She was actually only alone 3 out of 7 days. When we went to see her, it would take the entire day away from our duties at home and our families. We both had 2 hour drives each way and we would be wrecked by the time we got home. We did all of the house cleaning, lawn work until I hired a company to do it, upkeep on the house, took her out for lunch and ran her to do any shopping she needed to do. I was diagnosed with hep C and had to inject low dose chemo 3 times a week for a year. I also was caring for my mother in law and volunteered at a local nursing home. Along with cleaning moms home and mowing her yard, I also took care of my 5 bedroom home and mowed our acreage. The mowing at home took 7 hours every week. We also farm and my husband works full time. The injections made me feel like holy hell and caused me to be overly emotional and depressed. I had never been depressed before and I was in my forties, going through menopause at the same time. Something had to give. No matter which house I was at, I felt guilty for not being at the other one. My mom and my husband did little to relieve that pressure. My brother had to have brain surgery for tic douloureux which he had been suffering from for months. This was when we told mom that our lives were so disrupted by many factors that we had to make changes. She moved to the nursing home where I volunteered and it was a mile from my home. I wont repeat the details but if you are interested, please go to my Quora profile and read about this and many other experiences to do with nursing homes and elderly. Her living in the nursing home was the best thing that had happened for our relationship in years. I was in and out of the facility multiple times a day. I was involved in every aspect of her care. I made certain she was being taken care of properly and not neglected. She and I were able to spend our time together doing pleasurable things instead of rushing around and working. Mom died after being in the home just short of a year. I dont regret the decision to have mom move into a nursing home. Neither did she. We were closer than we had ever been and I miss her every minute of every day. RIP Mama How do I deal with my demanding elderly mother who insists on staying in her home but can no longer take care of things? How did you take care of the house when your mom got sick for a few weeks or even months? My girlfriend is a housekeeper and she says a guy is willing to pay her 300 a day for the remaining 4 days that he's there, just to watch her clean. Should she let him? I told the helper to stop cleaning my room and my mom told her to continue and she's still cleaning it. How do I get her to stop? My mom charges me 175 a week for rent and childcare and I'm always broke by the end of paying. What do I do? What if my mom treats me like a maid? She tells me to clean the house all by myself, and tells me to clean my brothers room since its a mess . All she does is clean the dishes and barely cooks. I'm only 14 speaking from experience as someone whos parents tried this EXACT method on me, and it ended up being severely damaging, and it took nearly a decade of living on my own before I was able to mostly correct the issues it caused. When you remove his possessions, the lesson you are teaching him is that nothing he owns is really his. if he does not feel like he really owns anything, then what incentive does he have to take care of it? and if he doesnt feel like any of his possessions are really his, then he likely doesnt feel like his room is his either, in which case why should he feel any sense of responsibility for it? By using this method of punishment, to this extreme, you have inadvertently exacerbated the problem. this is ESPECIALLY true if any of the items you took away where things that he purchased or earned for himself The first thing you need to teach him is taking pride in the things that are his, and to take care of them. In order to do that, you need to restore his sense of ownership. Begin by returning the items to him, start with anything he purchased or earned himself, and apologize for it. its a hard pill to swallow but its the only way you can start rebuilding any trust. assure him that you will not be using that method of punishment again, but that he WILL be expected to take care of his own possessions, because they are his. Next, find other ways to punish him. If he gets an allowance, and refuses to clean his room. just do it for him, and keep a portion of the allowance from him that week 80 is a good amount, make a show of having his allowance ready to give to him, but then before handing it over remove that 80 and let him know that was the cleaning fee. This will be much more effective because its not taking away anything that he owns, but its still punishing him, and its also teaching him in a very visceral way that if you expect others to do things for you, that there will be a cost associated with it. It may take some time, but eventally he will get tired of having his allowance cut by such a large amount and will start cleaning himself. even if its not perfect right away, reward small steps, if you clean his room and you find he put his laundry away for himself for example, only take 60 that week. etc, this will encourage him to start taking more initiative for himself. What should I do if my child does not clean his room I've taken everything they have I took their phone their consoles their computer but he just won't clean his room what should I do I've asked him nicely I don't want to hit him or anything he's 13? My mom pays 250 a month for a housekeeper to come in but she only mops and vacuums she won't even sweep and won't clean any surfaces. Is my mom getting scammed?"

The best way to do this is by careful manual control of a spray bottle, actuating the trigger in small squirts to achieve a result. Large areas are best cleaned by using a dilute aqueous solution of concentrate from a plain bottle, acting according to manufacturers instructions.

41,What are some of the billiard tricks that beginners should know,"OK, here is something every wouldbe excellent player must be able to do. At one end of the table, simply hit a cue ball to the opposite bunker with about enough force to return to you. You should be able to get it to return exactly to the point you hit it from, which means that if you keep your cue in position, it will come back and squarely hit the tip of the cue. In order to do this, you have to be able to hit the cue ball with no sidespin or English, as its called in the game. If you cant do this, it means that you are inadvertently going to put sidespin on the cue ball, which in turn will affect the direction the object ball goes. It wont affect a game of 8ball on a small table in a bar, but on a full table in a serious game, youll not have enough control to properly use English meaning youll be unable to execute shots that require it, and your accuracy will be off by enough to affect your success in a serious game.

You rinse the glasses under running warm water , then apply a spot of dish soap or actual lens cleaner on both sides of the lenses , then wipe both sides with your fingers. Then rinse under water again. Then use a tissue  Kleenex type to dry the lenses. Our industry has used tissues to wipe lenses for 100 years. Use the cheap brands because the more expensive brands have lotion in them and just make things worse. If the lenses are wet , there is nothing softer than a tissue . There is no cloth that absorbs more or better. THEN you can use the microfiber cloth to very lightly give them a final polish . Body oils and grease tends to accumulate around the nose pads and around the lenses between the lens and the frame. That has to be cleaned out with warm water and soap otherwise you just keep spreading it all over the lenses. When I use my cloth to clean my prescription glasses, it leaves behind like a greasy film across the lens. Why wont they clean the lens properly? Am I damaging my eyes by not wearing my prescription glasses? Does it have any impact? Why can glasses just have the lens replaced? What is the 'cylinder' portion of an eyeglass prescription? How is this ground into the lens? How can I keep the cloth that I use to wipe my glasses down clean? Why is it that I can see better from the bottom part of my glasses' lenses than the center of the lense? Just a dry cloth will not clean glasses well. You need to at least do what I call huffing on the lens first. Huffing is holding the lens close to your mouth arms open and pointing upwards and ha air on both sides of one lens. Then wipe both sides at once, by holding lens in between cloth covered fingers and wipe. You can also wash lenses under warm water with a tiny drop of dishwashing detergent to remove grease and oils. However, its much easier to buy a little bottle of spray cleanser from your optometrist. You spray it on both sides, and clean with cloth as above. It not only cleans but fog proofs the lenses. Good luck. Kx When I use my cloth to clean my prescription glasses, it leaves behind like a greasy film across the lens. Why wont they clean the lens properly? Are you not using anything but the cloth? Like, no lens cleaner? Theres your problem. Its not great for the environment, but pick up a box of generic, nonamebrand lens cleaner wipes, which come impregnated with the solution. Never, ever wipe your lenses dry in any case  large dust or dirt particles can scratch the lenses if you do that. When I use my cloth to clean my prescription glasses, it leaves behind like a greasy film across the lens. Why wont they clean the lens properly? Because you have a greasy cloth When you mop the floor you constantly change the water in the bucket, otherwise you are just redistributing the dirt. Unless you carefully wash and dry that cleaning cloth every day it quickly holds more dirt and grease than is on the lenses  and even if washed it can hold particles which can scratch lens coatings.

When I use my cloth to clean my prescription glasses, it leaves behind like a greasy film across the lens. Why wont they clean the lens properly? What is the best microfiber cloth for cleaning glass lenses? Why? Since wearing the correct prescription glasses contacts seems to weaken my eyes, does that mean I should get a weaker prescription to strengthen them? What happens when I wash my eyeglasses too often? How do I replace my glasses lenses? How can I keep the cloth that I use to wipe my glasses down clean? Maybe the cloth needs a wash.

47,Can you mix rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol with acetone as a cleaning solution or do not mix those two Is it dangerous to mix the two or the two dont react so you can use them both at the same time for,"Can you mix rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol with acetone as a cleaning solution, or do not mix those two? Is it dangerous to mix the two, or the two don't react, so you can use them both at the same time for cleaning? All the above solvents are safe to mix. They wont react. Similar mixtures are routinely used in cromatography   HPLC, but the advantage of such a mixture as a cleaning agent is not clear to me. Note that the fumes, especially that of acetone, are flammable and can explode, and theyre also toxic when inhaled in large amounts. Can you mix rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol with acetone as a cleaning solution, or do not mix those two? Is it dangerous to mix the two, or the two don't react, so you can use them both at the same time for cleaning? Does isopropyl alcohol dissolve thermal paste? What rubbing alcohol should I use for cleaning? Why is the strongest isopropyl alcohol that is available only 99 and not 100? Can I dilute 91 isopropyl rubbing alcohol into 70? How can isopropyl alcohol be made at home? Here is a simple approach followed by an explanation of why it works. You dont need to have taken a chemistry course to follow it, and you dont need laboratory measuring tools. If you find only 91 isopropyl alcohol available buy it and dilute it to 70, because the 30 water makes it more effective at killing virus. The simple way to do this is to add 0.3 part water three tenths to one part 91 alcohol. More generally, divide the higher concentration by the lower concentration and subtract one, to get the amount of water to add to alcohol, by ratio of parts. The utility of using a ratio in parts water to parts alcohol is that any measurement units can be used. You can scale up the ratio to make it more convenient, say, 3 parts water to ten parts 91 alcohol. Whatever the capacity of your measuring container, put in 3 of water and ten of 91 alcohol. Why does this work? When you dilute the alcohol the amount of alcohol remains the same while the concentration and volume change. The amount of alcohol is the concentration times the volume, C times V. So C1 times V1 equals C2 times V2 because no alcohol has been added or subtracted. Setting V1 to a value of one allows a calculation by parts instead of units. Subtracting one part from the total volume gives the amount of water to be added, per part. The trick is to have a container for measuring and mixing and storing. The bottles of alcohol you buy will be full. It is better to measure the water first rather than add it to alcohol until the desired volume level is reached in the alcohol container. Alcohol absorbs water, so that the volume of the two when mixed is less than the combined separate volumes of each. The new concentration is correct even while the total volume is slightly less than expected by simply adding the numbers. I had to figure all this out for myself from instructions for solution dilution in the lab, which assume you have the knowledge and equipment.  ,  As an added note on my own answer, it is hard to find isopropyl alcohol on the store shelves. A restocked shelf is quickly emptied. I havent seen 91 solution since March, just 70, and the only ones left, if there are any left, are 16 oz size, no quart sized. I have only one quart of 91 left to dilute, but ample supplies of 70 half quarts, which are easier to hold when pouring. I pour from the 16 oz size into my 2 oz spray bottles. I urge people to use a spray and spread with a hand, rather than waste alcohol by using a cloth or paper towel. If you use a wiping rag most of the alcohol will be absorbed by the material and evaporate, only a portion will be spread on the surface. By contrast, If you use the spray and hand spread method, your hand is protected by the alcohol and you can feel directly to be sure that the whole surface is covered. The 70 solution doesnt damage my skin. Using this method, an ounce of alcohol goes a long way. Smaller 2 oz spray bottles are more efficient and can be carried with you. I have one in my car and one on my person. I should note that mini spray bottles are sold out fast, so they must be in demand. At a self serve gas station, first spray your hands then operate the pump. When finished, again spray down and rub your hands together before you open the door to your car, rubbing the spray bottle itself as you rub your hands. Other than myself, I have not seen anyone take precautions at a gas pump, so you can be pretty sure that sooner or later the fixtures that have to be handled will be contaminated. This procedure is very quick and sure, no risk of being harassed for taking precautions. Can I dilute 91 isopropyl rubbing alcohol into 70? 70 Isopropyl Alcohol the concentrations of 60 and 90, Isopropyl alcohol is a very effective agent against microbial bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Higher concentrations dont generate a much more desirable effectiveness against bacteria, fungi and viruses. This is because, there has to be a significant enough presence of water with the Isopropyl alcohol in order to be effective. And this percentage of water needs to be at least more than 10 within the solution. And the mixture of 30 water with 70 Isopropyl alcohol works best . The reason water is so important is because it acts as a catalyst and has a major role in denaturing the proteins of cell membranes of vegetative cells. 70 IPA solutions are very effective in breaching the cell wall fully. Also, the presence of water slows down evaporation and increases the surface contact time with the membrane. With 91 IPA, the evaporation is instant and protein coagulates, rendering the effect of the IPA greatly reduced. This means that 91 IPA takes a greater time to act and doesnt kill as much bacteria as 70 IPA. The latter is also cheaper. 99 Isopropyl Alcohol This concentration of IPA is not as commonly used as a disinfectant, but as a solvent or cleaning agent for industries that produce products that are sensitive to water. Hence, it makes sense to use a hydrophobic solvent. It also has a very low flash point and hence, evaporates rapidly. This is useful in computer and electronics manufacturing industries that prefer immediate evaporation of cleaning agents for their work. During the design work for chips and circuit boards and integrated circuits, there needs to be a quick clean up if something is spilled and the work area needs to be devoid of any contaminants or obstructions as soon as possible 99 IPA ensures that happens. Rapid evaporation has a downside to it since it reduces shelf life, but on the other hand, it ensures little to no dilution in alcohol content, and hence it is preferred for great consistency. Both these materials are non corrosive to metals and are plastic safe as well. They are ozone safe and have a low impact on the climate. They are both flammable, the 99 variant much more so because of its high flash point so they need to be stored in places without any danger of fire. Note  What is the difference between 70 and 91 isopropyl alcohol? Can you mix rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol with acetone as a cleaning solution, or do not mix those two? Is it dangerous to mix the two, or the two don't react, so you can use them both at the same time for cleaning?"

59,Can you mix Isopropyl alcohol with windex to use for cleaning or would that not be recommended And why not or is it fine to mix the two,"I'm not sure why you would do that. You could, but it would make more sense to just buy an alcohol based glass cleaner. There is one available from the Windex brand, if that's what you like. Avoid the ammoniated glass cleaners altogether. That said, the price of alcohol has skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic, so there's a counterargument in terms of price. Alcohol based anything is about twice the price it was a year ago. Can you mix Isopropyl alcohol with windex to use for cleaning, or would that not be recommended? And why not, or is it fine to mix the two? Can you mix rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol with acetone as a cleaning solution, or do not mix those two? Is it dangerous to mix the two, or the two don't react, so you can use them both at the same time for cleaning? Is it safe to combine isopropyl alcohol and butane? If ever so, can it somehow disinfect in some way? Why are all isoalcohols except isopropyl alcohol primary alcohols? What proportions should I mix 50 isopropyl alcohol with 91 isopropyl alcohol to get at least a 70 solution to disinfect coronavirus? How do I prepare isopropyl alcohol from 1 propanol? Acetone is not an alcohol, but a ketone. Like alcohol, it is readily miscible with water, and with alcohol, which answers your question. Both are solvents, but acetone is the more powerful of the two. They are not used for the same purposes. For example, acetone will remove nail polish and varnish buildup from carburetors. Acetone will damage surfaces that rubbing alcohol will not, as it has the ability to dissolve many plastics, e.g., it will melt polystyrene in seconds. I would not recommend using acetone, or a mixture containing acetone, for cleaning jobs that call for alcohol, like removing ink stains from fabric. However acetone excels at removing gummy residues and stickers from surfaces on which it us safe to use, like glass. I dont see any reason to mix the two. You would end up with a mixture that might not be suitable for jobs calling for one solvent or another. But they are both handy to keep around.

62,Who is still using hydrochloric acid to clean toilets,"I use it only when the calcium deposits get bad. Maybe once a year. I use swim pool acid muriatic because you can buy it every where cheaply. i clean all water out of a toilet with a dipper cup and sponge and then use a weed blower to clean out the rest. After cleaning there will be a pool of acid at the bottom. I get a used tooth brush and clean all over the inside of the pipe leaving the toilet. The rest of the year i use plain vinegar, very cheap, clean, let it set and then use the same vinegar to clean again. Never use an abrasive on a toilet like cleaning powder. It will scratch the porcelain leaving space for Mold to grow. Who is still using hydrochloric acid to clean toilets?

Never use acid to try to unclog a drain. pH range 0 most acidic  7 neutral  14 most basic Strong acids release H into aqueous water solution. Strong bases release OH into solution. A solution of water H2O, is pH 7 or neutral notice that H  OH  H2O  ,  Draino and similar products are strong bases, such as potassium hydroxide KOH with a pH of 14. Hard water is slightly basic or alkaline. How hard the water is depends on how much Ca2 and Mg2 ions they add at the water treatment plant. Beyond that, hard water actually strengthens pipes, by adding a crusty precipitate Water that is slightly basic 7 up to drain uncloggers which are as basic as can be 14 these solutions are generally safe for pipes On the other hand, acid or solutions that less than pH 7 will corrode pipes, wearing away at their integrity and and becoming soluble, as free metal ions.  ,  Acid has a reputation in popular media as being able to burn, destroy, disintegrate substances, Some might consider that possibly greasy, hair, clogs in a drain, could be broken up with acid. But acids are not good at that sort of thing at least not as true as it for bases. Instead strong acid could destroy your plumbing as it sits in the pipes leaving gaping holes in pipes Instead strong acid can react very unexpected as a rapid exothermic reaction when mixed suddenly in large volume of water, splashing back in ones face Never put something like HCl down a drain. A little vinegar pH 4 might be good for cleaning the pores of a clogged shower head, but thats as strong as any acid should be as far as plumbing is concerned. Plumbing flux is the exception, being acidic so that the oxidized surfaces of metal copper pipes can be cleaned before soldering them together.

In the wake of the ongoing global health crisis, consumers are more dependent on accurate and uptodate online information than ever. This moment highlights how fundamental a wellexecuted search experience is to a brands core customer service and conversion strategy  not just during a crisis, but always. At Yext, we believe the ultimate source for official answers about a business online should be the business itself. However, when consumers ask questions on company websites, too often they are left in the dark with wrong answers.  Giving customers the essential information they need, everywhere they search, is key to winning and keeping consumer trust. And delivering official answers is mission critical. Keep reading to learn why  and how your brand can deliver on that promise while also maximizing ROI. If youre not delivering answers on your website, your customers will look elsewhere.

The first step to creating an elevated search experience is understanding what people are asking about your brand to do this, you must make sure your websites search functionality is optimized for discerning a customers true intent when searching  and delivering answers accordingly To achieve this, your site search architecture needs to be able to understand and process natural language as advances in  For example, if youre a haircare brand, your customer probably isnt searching justnfor the keyword shampoo he or she is searching for Best shampoo and conditioner combination for dry hair, which showcases clear intent to find and purchase products for a certain hair type Surfacing a series of links that mention the keyword shampoo isnt a sufficient response because it isnt serving your customers intent, which makes it less likely that they will convert and act on their intent to buy a product on the other hand, a great answer to that onsite search would be a product page for a shampoo and conditioner set specifically made for dry hair with a builtin purchase button Delivering these highly targeted, responsive, conversionoptimized answers helps your customers to take action thats why understanding natural language and putting direct answers on your website to help consumers convert  right in the search results  is the foundation of  To be in control of the information consumers are finding about your brand, you must extend your search experience endeavor beyond your own website.

Have you tried using one of these with dishwashing gloves?  ,  This device is an automated supermarket casher. Whe you shop you use it to read the bar code of your products, then you insert the machine in a  Now, when should you use disposable goves? You only need them briefly while at the store. You put them on as you grab the cart if you use it at all, take them out as you leave. If you are being served by an assistant you dont even need the gloves as you will not be touching anything in the shop. One thing you should never do its wear the gloves throughout the day or, anyhow, from the moment you leave home to the moment you come back. The gloves do not protect your hands you dont catch Covid19 through the skin, they are used to protect the others from getting in contact with surfaces that you contaminated. If you don the gloves before leaving home and take them off once you are back home nd wear them for hours you are actually less aware of how many surfaces you touch, and you end up picking up lots of viruses and bacteria. Basically, the gloves worn for a long time are a vehicle for the infection. Based on the same principle, wearing dishwashing gloves, besides being extremely impractical, causes you to reuse the same gloves over and over. These gloves cant be properly disinfected as they get damaged by the common disinfection procedures overtime. Indeed, the best strategy is not wearing gloves at all unless you are shopping or using the transit system. Instead, carry both a piece of soap and paper towels to wash your hands any time you can, and a bottle of sanitizer to clan your hands with if you dont have any water available. Why do people not use washable dishwashing gloves to protect from coronavirus COVID19? I havent heard anyone mention 'singleuse plastics' for two months. Of course they do, but you must dispose of them after each discrete use. When I go shopping, I use one pair for each location I enter, and dispose of each pair as I leave. That is, if I go to 3 stores, I use 3 pairs. If I go to 10 stores, I use 10 pairs. The protection is to not touch your face with a dirty hand, gloved or ungloved. Youd be surprised how often you touch your faceeyes, nose, mouth, ears. Gloves are outofstock at many stores now. Try to get some. I bought 600 pair before the mad rush, wish I had bought more. Do disposable gloves protect against COVID19? Are they recommended for the public? Are there gloves with antiviral coating that would lower the probability of infection from touching a contaminated surface? Can latex gloves and disposable gloves really prevent spreading COVID19? Is it safe to clean with diluted bleach without gloves? Is it dangerous to clean a microwave with bleach? Can you wash your hands with protective gloves on to clean the gloves for reuse? Why doesn't this work? You better off washing your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. The chemicals in the gloves dont leach but your skin including the skin on your hands needs t breath dish washing gloves will hinder this. You will also loose the dexterity and are more likely to have accidents. Use the gloves to wash dishes, and wipe down all the things you touch frequently with disinfectant then take them off and let them dry. Is it safe to use dishwashing gloves for everyday use?

87,Do you use a checklist for your chores cleaning and household tasks Or just take care of them as needed,"I have a checklist. Oh, God, do I have a checklist. There are certainly people who just see a dirty or untidy space and just clean it. I cant and I dont. I have routines for the daily stuff. Make the bed, do a quick wipedown of the sink and commode, that sort of thing, I have a list that I take care of weekly, and I have a very long list of detail cleaning tasks that rotates over a period of about 17 weeks. Things like cleaning the oven or washing windows, or deep cleaning closets. The real reason I have those lists written down in a household notebook is that my husband and I sat down and agreed on what needed to be done and when. I have the lists printed up in sheet protectors in a notebook on the kitchen counter. That means we know what needs to be addressed and when. It sounds rigid, I know, and people think its overwhelming or perfectionistic, but its not. The house is never perfect and its always okay. Neither of us love to clean or anything, but we do like a tidy home. So cleaning whenever would be cleaning never for us. Then wed get all overwhelmed and clean it to perfection, which would say in that state for an hour or so until it got so nasty we did a whirlwind clean againg. This is much, MUCH easier.

I can see whats cluttered and whats dirty, and I can ignore it equally well whether or not its written down. Either that, or I get to it as a matter of routine. The dishwasher fills up, I put detergent in, I run it, and I empty it so the dirty dishes dont pile up on the counter. My husband does his share of dishes and laundry, too. I do sometimes put calendar or task list reminders in my phone for things that need less frequent attention or that are less visible, such as rotating the tires on the car or cleaning the dryer vent or the refrigerator coils. Tastefully Minimalist Do you use a checklist for your chores, cleaning and household tasks? Or just take care of them as needed? I make a grocery list as I have no memory.

94,Why was soap created to only kill 99 99 of germs and viruses,"You are confusing products like bleach and antiseptic wipes and some antibiotic products like hand washes with added chemicals in them with soap. Soap does kill bacteria it disrupts their cell wall but it is not 99.9 effective at doing so. It is much less effective than that I cannot be bothered to find the stats but another answer below has already done it. Companies like Domestos make claims like this all the time in their advertising for their antiseptic cleaning products in order to point out to you the benefits of using them over the gold standard of just soap or washing up liquid. And they are better at killing bacteria than soap or washing up liquid just not actually 99.9 effective in a live situation. The misdirection you have here is that the products are tested in a lab. This means a standard test, sometimes designed by the manufacturer themselves rather than an independent body, using a set type of bacteria in a standard set of conditions on a petri dish and using different amounts of the product in question. And they dont release all the results of these tests, just quote the data from the ones that get the required killing power. So, it sounds all sciency and shit but really it isnt. If they were reporting the results scientifically, you would not get a simple, single number. Youd get a range of concentrations, showing the effects on different bacteria in different circumstances and using different ways to measure the results. And, the added issue is that it is likely none of these tests would involve someone washing their hands with the stuff and then measuring the effect. Mainly because it would be very difficult to get a consistent set of results where you could quantify the number of bacteria on your hands before and after the experiment. So, you are not getting a real life result and more than you are when you test drugs on mice. So, these antiseptic wipes cleaning sprays will be better than ordinary soap still just not 99.9 effective. But, to be honest, you dont actually need to completely kill all bacteria. In fact, that would be a bad thing to do as that would mean killing all the friendly bacteria on your skin and that makes you more likely to get infected by pathogens those normal flora take up space so prevent the pathogens from getting space to grow. What an antiseptic or soap really needs to do is wash away the pathogens before they get a chance to take root  reducing their numbers is sufficient. You will still kill some normal flora but they should regrow faster than the pathogens that are left and reduce the probability of infection. Why was soap created to only kill 99.99 of germs and viruses? If soap doesnt kill anything, what is the best way to hand wash your dishes and spread fewer germs? What is in these antibacterial soaps that claims to keep germs away for hours after washing hands? Why do germs exist? How can we avoid them? Does dish soap kill or get rid of bacteria and viruses the same way hand soap does? How does washing hands with soap kill viruses? The function of soap which mainly helps clean our hands   skin, without soap, fatty dirt is difficult to destroy. With this the dirt and most of the germs are eliminated. This is how soap works, not to kill germs. There is no way we can get rid of 100 of germs and viruses from our hands   skin, that's just reducing the numbers.  ,  This is a logarithmic scale, 2 means 10  2  1 100, 3 means 10  3  1   1,000 Washing your hands and cleaning your hands with soap for a long time is usually better off than using soap that contains the disinfectant   ,  But  ,  Most soap manufacturers advertise their product capable of killing 99.9 of germs, but does it truly happen?  One study demonstrated that handwashing with soap and water removes the presence of bacteria to only 8. This indicates that washing hands with soap still does not leave germs to 0.1 even when done in a laboratory, let alone a realworld application. One important thing to note is that soap is not really killing the germs in our hands, but rather washing them away. In a scenario where a soap really removes 99.9 of germs, the remaining 0.1 may sound insignificant. But when we are talking about the number of germs, we should be considering millions of them which is why it could still be dangerous. However, as long as we maintain regular sanitation habits supported by a strong immune system, we should be fine So when a soap manufacturer claims that their products kill 99.9 of germs, they are technically correct but practically wrong. Although their lab results are not entirely misleading, it is indeed a powerful marketing message   ,  Sources CocokLogika WordPress at The University of Melbourne Why was soap created to only kill 99.99 of germs and viruses? You are making an assumption thats all wrong, sorry to say. Soap wasnt created to kill  Originally, soap came to exist by way of what was probably a sort of happy accident and certainly not a deliberate process. Once that happened it was found to be very useful for washing and cleaning so people kept refining it and trying to make better soap. At the time, in our distant prehistory, when soap first came to exist, nobody had the least clue that bacteria or viri even existed, let alone wanted to find a way to kill most of them. Why was soap created to only kill 99.99 of germs and viruses? Well, we dont want to kill 100 of something, thats just mean. All kidding aside, humans invented soap long before we knew bacteria and viruses even existed the Babylonian civilization could produce a soaplike substance by 2800 BC. For literally thousands of years we thought it just made us smell nicer. The fact that its pretty good at getting us rid of germs is only a wonderful coincidence. Why was soap created to only kill 99.99 of germs and viruses? If a simple soap can kill the COVID19 virus, then why is it so difficult for us to find a cure for it? Does soap kill the CoVID19 virus or only wash it away? Why are people panicbuying hand sanitizer, antibacterial soap, and bleach when none of those are effective against viruses? If I drop a bar of soap in the shower, will the bar be covered in germs from the floor? What alternatives to purell hand sanitizers are there that are effective at killing germs and viruses? Viruses are just like people, no virus or germs kills 100, some will survive. So it was not designed to just kill 99.99 that just the best it can do.

What is the best way to eliminate the musty moldy smell coming from a bathroom sink drain? We cant use products like Drano because of chemical sensitivities in the family. How do you get rid of the bad smell of bathrooms? Why do the other bathrooms in my house smell bad when the master bathroom shower is used no sign of drain or sewer vent issue? From a logical standpoint, the bad smell can only originate from the drain pipe system. Somehow, the bad air inside these pipes winds up in the other bathrooms. Since these are not your main bathroom, chances are they are rarely being used. That would result in the water trapped in the siphons or trap, as seems to be the correct technical term to slowly evaporate. That trapped amount of water is a functional part of the siphon contraption separating the bad air within the pipes from the ambient air in your room. Under normal conditions, the water in the trap keeps getting refilled each time someone uses the connected sink, shower or bathtub. At a former workplace I was employed at, there was this exact problem of evaporation with a sink located in the middle of the large public bathroom which, I guess was supposed to catch the water in case of a water spill, so it wouldnt flood the rest of the building. This sink never caught any water, though, so it kept falling dry. After about two months, a weird type of fly could be spotted in the room. It clearly originated from the sewer system. At the same time, the air began to smell bad. Then I knew I had to fill the siphon with water to make it airtight again. The same can happen to the siphon of your toilet, your sink or your bath tub. Simply flush each toilet about once a month and turn the water on at your sink and bathtub or in the shower. Only about ten or twenty seconds will fully suffice in order to refill the traps underneath.

108,Is Madrid a clean city,"I would say so, it is fairly clean in my opinion, at least cleaner than most cities this size I've been to cleaner than Paris, much cleaner than Rome, more or less like Vienna perhaps Vienna a little cleaner, more or less like Berlin Madrid a little cleaner I know Madrilenians of all sorts will disagree because they live here and have stuff to complain about, but I invite them to travel and see what is achievable and what is normal, and see how Madrid is surprisingly clean in comparison with most equivalent cities. I mean it is a city, so by definition it is not the paradigm of cleanliness not sure that word exists. It definitely has its spots with the floor full of chewing gum and papers too  ,  It has its backstreet  ,  You know I love Rome, but the truth is if this were Rome it would be 10 times dirtier, the city centre's garbage is part of the charm in Rome and many European cities. Or so the governments want to pass it as. As a city it also has its protests and parties and what is basically urban life which is pretty dirty  ,  Its terraces full of people that throw all sort of garbage on the floor, from papers to food of all kinds, and the typical city pigeons that love it  ,  But also as a city it has its cleaning services and campaigns so that citizens take care of their garbage. And in my experience even some poorer areas of Madrid are much cleaner than its counterparts in other cities  ,   ,   ,  Besides, Madrid's floor is actually pretty interesting,  As Hemmingway said  Miguel de Cervantes  ,  Lope de Vega  ,  Or all sort of random sentences that God knows who wrote but are quite funny, they are funny love lines that honestly I think the government wrote to make couple walks a little more cheesy  ,  There's no better skyline than seeing you laid  ,  We went to make love and came back as if we had made war  ,  There's no better toast than the one your eye lashes make  ,  You are on my list of achieved dreams  ,  Because we all have been someone's secret once  ,  My most felt kiss me Is Madrid a clean city?

Do dishwashers wash your dishes or just rinse them off? Why do people start cleaning up when I come around? Are dishwashers worth the hassle? What are things people do wrong when using the dishwasher? Are microwave ovens as safe as they are routed to be? I never used a dishwasher in my life. Do they really work? Yes, automatic dishwashers work, very well and pretty efficiently, IF used as intended and if you take proper care of it. A dishwasher will get the dishes clean, make them sanitary, and dry them, using less water, energy and detergent than handwashing a full load of dishes, pots and pans, glasses and tableware. A dishwasher actually works by abrasion, blasting the soil and food remnants off the dishes, pots and pans,and tableware by spraying highpressure drops of water, and removing grease and stains with hot water and detergent.  ,  Intended use will include loading the dishwasher so that the water spray can reach all parts of the load, and so that the machines spray arms can move freely, and so that the load will not collect and hold dirty water and detergent. using a form and amount of detergent that is correct for an automatic dishwasher, and perhaps a surfactant rinse agent to leave the dishes, glassware and tableware shiny and free from water spots. NOT washing the dishes before loading them in the dishwasher. A preliminary rinse would not interfere with washing, especially if the dishwasher has no builtin garbage disposal. Taking proper care will include proper installation of all electrical connections and plumbing, proper and secure mechanical placement of the machine, using water with neither too little too soft nor too much mineral content too hard and no unusual acidity.nFailing to make a proper connection to a good electrical ground can cause speedy rusting and leaking, a poor drain connection and holding water can cause leaks over time, and imbalance or loose mounting can allow vibration to damage the installation. Are dishwashers worth the hassle? I never used a dishwasher in my life. Do they really work? Why do some parents choose to do chores the oldfashioned way? Cant they just buy robot vacuum cleaners and use dishwashers? No, not everyone can just buy robot vacuum cleaners and use dishwashers. My husband wanted a robot vacuum for years, practically since the Roomba first came out. Why didnt we get one? Well, because theyre too expensive. My motherinlaw gave us one for Christmas two years ago. We use it a lot less often than my husband thought we would and hes disappointed that none of our pets want to ride it. It does a great job, but we have pets so I do still need to sweep first and I need to pick everything up all over the house and listen for it to get stuck or cause some other disturbance so it isnt like I can run it when Im not home. It also takes hours to finish. We dont own our home so when we rent a house, if it has a dishwasher, we use it. I havent lived in a house with a dishwasher in over 20 years. in fact, its entirely possible that Ive never rented a house or apartment that had one until the house Im currently in. I certainly dont remember ever having one in any place Ive paid to live in. So why wouldnt I get one? Those are also expensive. And while I love the one I have, to be able to have one in a rental that didnt come with one, I would need to buy a freestanding one. Again, expensive. Worth it, though, so if we ever move again, I definitely want a place with a dishwasher, but I cannot afford to buy one. And, you may be interested to know that sometimes the oldfashioned way of doing things works better. Sometimes my broom works better in a space than my stick vac. Sometimes my regular mop and bucket works better or is better for the type of floor I have than a steam mop. Sometimes the electricity doesnt work or the cord isnt long enough and you dont have an extension cord handy. Sometimes, if a room is small enough, I have to scrub a floor by hand to do a good job of it. Sometimes elbow grease is necessary. And sometimes, not all of your dishes should be put in the dishwasher cast iron needs to be cleaned with salt or a mesh rag and then dried on the stove, not washed, and certainly not ever put in a dishwasher or is too big to go in the dishwasher I have at least one skillet that doesnt fit. So even if you have the new automated equipment, it isnt always the best thing for the job. Why do some parents choose to do chores the oldfashioned way? Can't they just buy robot vacuum cleaners and use dishwashers? I use Tub O Towels HeavyDuty Cleaning Wipes. Tub O Towels HeavyDuty Cleaning Wipes is one of the best oven cleaner brands today. You can use it for the hands, tools, and majority of surfaces to remove heavy stains like ink, grease, drinks, lipstick, and much more. This best cleaner is gentle on the hands because it contains lanolin, vitamin E, and Aloe Vera. It is the only product that uses Aloe Vera. It is the best product according to the best oven cleaner reviews and customer reports. In choosing the best product, consider if you need an easy offgrill cleaner because you want to remove yearsworth of gunk, and the ingredients. Make sure that nothing is compromised because you do not want to waste time and money. Feedback You also have to read the customer reviews and see what the common complaint is because most likely, it is true. However, the verdict is still up to you and how you are going to use it. The time required  ,  Consider how much time the cleaner needs to work effectively before debris and grease washes off with it. If you did not clean for months, expect to allow at least 24 hours, but the producer should not take more than that. Ingredients It is crucial that there are no toxic ingredients in it because the food will touch your grill. As said  Fumes There should be no harmful fumes coming from it that could harm your eyes or even skin in case you accidentally touch it. What is the best product for cleaning up a kitchen oven? What's the best oven cleaner for removing deep grease and grime? How often should you clean your microwave? Why do people fuss when they clean? What makes something dishwasher safe or unsafe? Why was is so hard to clean the oven? What are the benefits of having two dishwashers at home? Basic oven care  The more often, the easier. If the internal surface of the oven is wiped after each cooking, and once a week or one and a half to steam the oven with water and detergent, there will be practically no global cleaning. To give dirt a little better, warm up the oven a little by turning it on at 50  C for 1520 minutes. Immediately before cleaning, remove the trays, remove the side guides. If the design allows, also remove the door and glass. All this is more convenient to wash separately. Do not use abrasive sponges and metal scrapers. Scrubbing their fat, they can damage the enamel of the oven. It is better to work with a sponge or soft cloth. Never apply the cleaning agent, especially chemical, on the fan and the heating elements of the oven. After cleaning, leave the oven door open for a couple of hours so that it dries out, and extraneous smells evaporate. Did the smell remain? Dissolve 1015 tablets of activated carbon in a glass of water and put in the oven for several hours. Coal absorbs excess odors. How can I keep my oven clean? Homes are made more airtight now then ever before. So much so that a gas oven MIGHT be consuming so much oxygen out of the air as to lower the partial pressure of that gas O2 from normally about 19 down to somewhere closer to 14 and THAT would almost certainly cause lightheadedness in some and if lower than 14 almost assuredly the same affect on everyone. Such feelings are just a step or two from unconsciousness, too. Opening the doors and windows are a solution as you are then introducing more air into the atmosphere of your house. Another thing that you might wish to consider is turning the fan on at your thermostat and letting it run, circulating the air in your home and increasing the amount of air affected by the oven cleaning. Why do gas ovens make everyone feel lightheaded during their selfcleaning cycle? Most people are house proud and would do a quick tidy up if someone pops around unexpectedly. This is WHY it is polite, civil and courteous to ALWAYS phone first BEFORE you decide to call in on someone Personally, I believe people who just drop around without notice are illmannered, show a distinct lack of consideration for others and a total disregard for other peoples privacy I never drop around to peoples places unexpectedly because I dont like people doing it to me. Just because a person has spare time on their hands and wants to be entertained for a couple of hours does NOT mean that their intended host has nothing else on his her plate It is thoughtless and presumptuous to expect friends or relatives to drop everything, change their plans or have their daily routines interrupted just because you decide to call in unannounced. How do you know that your intended hosts are not already entertaining other invited guests, are ill, have other plans or just simply want to laze around the house in their pyjamas and have a quiet day doing nothing? Do the right and courteous thing and PHONE FIRST  giving your intended host at least two hours notice  before you decide to dropin because YOU are at a loose end. Phone first, do NOT be offended if they ask you to make it another time and, if so, make another, more convenient, time for you to visit them Why do people start cleaning up when I come around?

130,Every time I get close to cleaning my room it ends up going back to being cluttered and a mess and I feel burnt out What is the best way to clean a room and keep it clean,"I think your frustration lies in the modern mindset compared to a hundred years ago, we now have the opportunity to engage in zillions of fun things, many of which do not even require physical effort such as watching TV or playing on the Internet. This mindset becomes seductive, drawing us further into a life of inertia. I get that way sometimes, too. A hundred years ago, unless you were wealthy and had servants, you were more inclined to get on with home tasks and not mope about them. You werent thrilled to clean the house, but you were proud when you finished, and didnt really think about it as a useless cycle. It was simply part of what you did in order to maintain a healthy and happy family and friendships. So, what should you do to make it easier to clean and be less mopey about it? Tell you what I do 1 I keep my home NEAT. This is a MAJOR factor in keeping away the depression I am prone to. And, if a new object comes into the house, something else must leave. 2 I listen to music as I dust, clean the toilets, wash the tub and change the bed linens. 3 I cant listen to music when Im vacuuming, so after I vacuum a room, I reward myself with some TV or music time. 4 I keep thinking that Im making my home healthier as I clean. 5 I keep thinking about the compliments I get on how nice my home looks. That means I am making others happy. Some people clean a room every couple of days. I deep clean everything once a month. No matter how you do it, it boils down to two things Keep it neat and organized, and develop a philosophy of personal gratitude that you have friends, family, and YOURSELF to clean for. Every time I get close to cleaning my room, it ends up going back to being cluttered and a mess and I feel burnt out. What is the best way to clean a room and keep it clean? How will we effectively clean room corners? Does vacuuming your room actually clean it? How can I clean my room fast  keep it clean? How can you clean a house in 20 minutes? What happened if you dont clean your house? How do I keep my room clean? Im 19 and I could never keep it clean for more than a week. Theres a difference between dirty and messy. Dirty requires cleaning. Messy requires organization. More likely than not, most of your issue is messiness and that is a fairly simple fix that will actually last and make your room easier to clean. So how do you do that? Well, your room will likely need to be decluttered and organized and that will require making your room even messier before you will get it clean. First, pick an area of your room you want to declutter and organize. Lets go with your closet first. Make your bed trust me and then take everything out of your closet yes, everything and put it on your bed. Go into your closet and clean all of the surfaces, including the rod, any shelving, and the floor. Go through each and every single thing and either put it back in the closet neatly or put it aside for either throwing away or donating. I recommend organizing your clothing in the closet in a way that makes sense to you. For me, that means that all of my tops are on the left of the closet, my bottoms are in the middle, and dresses are on the right with outwear like jackets, sweaters, and coats on the far right. Each article of clothing are further organized by length short to long sleeve, short to long skirts and pants, short to long dresses, and progressively heavier weight outerwear. Same would go for shoes say from casual shoes to dressy and then boots. And then whatever else you keep in your closet. When the closet is completely done and your bed no longer has stuff on it, you can move on to your dresser. Empty the whole thing and get rid of what you dont want and fold and store what you do. Clean each drawer out with a soft cloth and cleaning solution. I recommend learning to fold so that you can use the file method of placing your clothes in your drawers. It saves space so you can fit more in your drawers and so that you can find what youre looking for without having to look under other things and make a mess of your drawers. Heres a video for that  ,  Once your dresser is full, you would move onto whatever other spaces you have in your room desk, nightstands, bookcases and do the same until your entire space is decluttered and organized. Empty, clean the area, decide what to keep and what to get rid of, put it all back in an organized way. When youre putting things back, do your best to put them back in a specific way, giving everything you own a specific place where it lives. This is important. When you use things, you will be able to find where it is. Once youre finished using it, put it back exactly where you got from immediately. If things dont have an official home, then you will leave them just wherever and that is what makes your room messy. Make your bed every morning. Dont leave dirty clothes on the floor, put them in a hamper or basket. When you do your laundry, fold or hang everything immediately after you finish and put them away. If you take a shirt off a hanger, put it on and then decide it isnt what you want to wear, hang it back up immediately. Doing things as you go and not procrastinating is what keeps your room clean and keeps you from having to spend an entire day cleaning and organizing your space every week. Once a week, all you should have to do is dust, change your sheets or wash and put them back on if you only have one set, do your laundry, and then do your floors. Why? Because you put everything back where it goes every day as you used it so you dont need to declutter and organize. And if you spot clean as you see a mess say you spilled a drink on your end table, you will not have to even worry about cleaning so much. How do I keep my room clean? Im 19 and I've could never keep it clean for more than a week. It would appear that you have built up some kind of mental block about fixing this problem you have, and it is actively preventing you from being able to get to work on solving it. That's okay. Take a deep breath. As others have suggested, you are probably just overwhelmed. It's a mental thing. Interestingly enough, clutter itself can cause you to feel discouraged to the point where you feel physically incapable of dealing with it. It sounds almost comical, but you are basically in a battle of wits between yourself and your mess. You're better than your mess. You can do this. You just need a strategy. You may be surprised to find that  I'll give you a simple rule to follow that will help you find a place to start and keep you focused throughout the process  Turn on some upbeat music or call a relative long distance pro tip mothers and sisters are great for this. You will be focusing 90 of your attention on something else while the remaining 10 picks up. Pro tip refer to cleaning as picking up as it sounds much less soul devouringly involved and tedious. I'm not  Taking it from the top This doesn't mean you have to mop the ceiling or anything. It doesn't even mean you need to dust your ceiling fan blades. That is some next level shit. We're operating on a solid Level One right now. Look down a little lower. Ahh, surfaces. A great starting point. Grab two laundry baskets empty ones and toss trash into one, misplaced items into the other. Do not think about where the misplaced items are supposed to go. That is a dark downward spiral waiting to happen. You must focus. Two categories Trash, and This Doesn't Go Here. You can do this. Repeat this process on all the surfaces in your bedroom, taking breaks between each one if necessary. Logically there should really only be a few surfaces. Your bed, dresser, maybe a nightstand and or a desk. This will probably take 15 minutes max. Stash the basket full of miscellaneous objects out of sight and set the one containing trash in the kitchen or garage or wherever your household's Main Trashcan you know the one is located. Then, take a break. Do not time your break. Do not clock yourself. Just take a break and then get back to work when you feel okay with doing that. Next floor. Repeat the exact same method on your bedroom floor, but add in one more laundry basket to toss clothes into. Again, much like the misc stuff basket, don't sort the clothes into multiple categories darks, whites, delicates, etc. It will only frighten you and make you cry. Not that I would know that from experience or anything. Stepnow Break time Indulge in something you love carbs, anyone? and marvel at the novelty of your newly unfucked room. Grab your baskets out of hiding. Not the clothes basket or the trash baskets. Just the misc baskets. There should be two of them. One from clearing your surfaces, the other from clearing the floor. One, two. Two is a very manageable number. If you disagree, place one of the baskets out of view and work on one at a time. It is a good idea to do the worst basket first to get it out of the way. If you simply cannot handle that, though, which is fine too by the way, work on the least intimidating basket first. The fact that you've confined your mess to two baskets means you've already won the war. This will be a fucking cake walk. Put your things away. Books go on your bookshelf. They don't have to be in alphabetical order. As long as you're getting the book onto the bookshelf, you my friend are getting the job done. Dirty dishes go into the kitchen sink. Those pens go into a cup on your desk. You get the idea. Break optional. Do your other misc basket. Break optional. Clothes basket Question Are these clean or dirty? Answer Fuggit, they've been on the floor, I have walked on them therefore, everything is dirty. Sort by color. Literally. Whites in one pile, colors aka everything else into another pile. Then go through the colors and further break them down into darks generally blacks, blues, grays, etc and brights yellows, reds, oranges, etc. In other words, you know how the tag on some clothing items will tell you to wash with like colors ? Toss your first load of laundry into the washer and go to your trash baskets. Dump them into the trash can dumpster. I would suggest rinsing the baskets out afterwards but hey this is a free country and that's totally up to you. Stack empty baskets together and store them wherever you store them. In your room or in the linen closet or on a shelf in the laundry room. I don't know where your laundry baskets go. I don't know your life. I don't know what you've been through. Now you should have a room that is free of trash, laundry, and miscellaneous items sitting everywhere. This will probably be enough to inspire you to keep going. Progress begets progressing. Sprinkle carpet freshener if applicable and leave it for now. Wipe down surfaces. Dust. Windex your mirror, it has hairspray all over it. Dust your windowsills and the drapes, they're embarrassing. Polish picture frames and sanitize doorknobs and lightswitches. Do this while wearing a surgeons mask over your mouth and nose if you have allergies. Vacuum. Use the hose extension to get into nooks and crannies. When you're done, it will amaze you to discover that you'll probably be incapable of stopping yourself from looking for more things to clean organize. Feel free to go all out. Cleaning your room will make you feel as if you have cleaned your entire life. You owe it to yourself to get started. You're the only one who has to live with not doing it. I believe in you. Why am I not able clean my room? I did a deep room clean but it still feels messy. What are some things organization tricks I can do to make my room feel tidy? So there is a difference between cleaning and organizing. If you actually both cleaned and organized, there may be other things you didnt consider regarding what could make your room feel messy. One would be making your bed every day. Another would be making sure that everything not in use should be in the space you designated for it. If it doesnt have a designated space, you need to make one for it and everything else that doesnt have a permanent space. How much stuff is still sitting on open surfaces like end tables, dresser, desk, shelving? How much stuff is on the floor? How much stuff is on the bed? Limiting the things that are openly visible in your room can give your eyes a place to rest instead of your eyes being overwhelmed by the things that it sees in your space. So if something doesnt actually belong out in the open, you should find a space for it that is more hidden. For example, if you keep all of your stuffed animals on your bed and you cant limit the number you own or arent willing to get rid of some of them, you need to consider another way to store them than on your bed. If you have a lot of office tools on your desk, you may want to consider getting organizers to hold them in. I have this great tea box set that I keep rubber bands, binder clips, and paper clips in. There are three cylinder boxes with lids and they fit into a rectangular box with a lid. I keep the lids for the cylinders closed and the boxes are pretty and I dont see the messiness of desk clutter. Other ideas include an additional set of drawers, possibly a cart, for all of the office supplies that dont fit in your desk and are creating a mess on your desk. Ideally, you would only have your computer, small storage containers with lids, and maybe a pencil holder on your desk and everything else. All paper, file folders, magazines, tape dispenser, stapler, staples, etc, would be neatly organized in drawers. I did a deep room clean but it still feels messy.

Put all the clean clothing that you havent put away together in one spoton a chair or in a clothes basket. Toss the shoes together into a pile or put them together into pairs. Notice that the clean clothing that isnt put up is clothing that you wear. Also, notice that dirty clothing is clothing that you wear. Clear the tops of furniture in the room.

140,Is it enough to just rinse my penis only with water when cleaning,"It is not. You need to use soap and water and manual washing. The genitals and general area inside your underwear are a warn and humid environment, very favorable to various microbes. You need soap and water and scrubbing for proper hygiene. Areas of particular concern The bottom side back area of your balls. Because of your underwear, it is closest to your anus and likely to have trapped microbes or traces of fecal material. Inside your foreskin, where it covers the head of your penis. This is a trap for dead skin and other material and a warm haven for bacteria. Failure do this, at best, will lead to bad smells. At worse to skin infections that fester, infect your blood, and eventually kill you. Touching yourself for hygiene is not improper or sexual. And for most people, not particularly enjoyable either.

142,Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before,"Maybe not unclean, but If there are too many clothes inside the detergent may not be evenly distributed or may be concentrated in certain areas and may damaged the clothes if they make it to the dryer or may force you to wash them again. Also if you continue to overload the washer it may increase wear on the washer leading you to have to repair things like the drive belt sooner when your average washer can last 10years or more. Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? Does detergent for dark clothes work? Can I wash my clothes without separating them? What costs more, washing clothes at home or washing clothes at the laundromat? Should I put the laundry detergent in first or the clothes? I got a new Maytag HE TopLoading Washer. It says put the detergent in first. When I do, the detergent drains right down the drain holes that cover the tub. Isn't this wasting detergent? Do washers without agitators get clothes clean? There is leeway. Socks, for example, are meant to get dirty and sweaty, so if one of those falls onto a relatively clean floor, I often look it over and see if theres anything on it. Socks fall fairly often, slipping out of the bundle of clothes. If its my husbands dress sock, I may have to think that one over, especially if any marks from the floor will show on the socks when he is at work. I am fussier with nice clothes. I often wash them separately, and then I do not drop them while transferring them to the dryer. The condition of the floor or rug in front of the washer dryer has a lot to do with my decision to rewash or not. If the floor is clean or the rugs are pretty clean, theres a good chance I can use the item after I have wiped it off. If something falls out of the dryer, often a few more minutes in the dryer will lift off any dust that may have gotten on it. This is my rule for tshirts and jeans. If I wouldnt cram so many clothing pieces into the washer dryer, I probably would not have a problem with items falling But I, like most people, just want to get the laundry finished. Again, dressy clothesI have to really think it over and see if there are any marks or dirt. Sometimes a dressy item is wrinkled just from falling out of the dryer. Then it usually gets washed dried again. Usually I handwash very old but nice or very delicate items, and falling out of anything is not a real problem. Is a piece of clothing dirty once it falls from the washing machine or dryer to the floor? Or is there some leeway? Detergents are, unfortunately, designed to leave some fragrance in the clothing. If you would rather not go around smelling like your laundry, I encourage you to select unscented, dyefree detergents, often marketed as Free and Clear. The marketers think they are selling them for people with allergies and sensitive skin, but anyone can buy unscented detergent. The better way to tell if you are using enough detergent is whether the water feels a little slippery or soapy if you pause it in the middle of a wash cycle. As long as it does, back off the amount a little next time. The test used to be if you saw suds, but many detergents usually labeled HE in the U.S. are formulated to be lowsuds, because the foam can build up in a frontloading washing machine, and cushion the clothes as they fall from the sides to the bottom, the action which is supposed to scrub them. Also, keep in mind that frontloaders use vastly less water than toploaders, so scale back the detergent if youre using a frontloading machine. Basically, if your clothes are getting cleaned, youre using enough detergent. More than necessary just makes for extra or incomplete rinsing. If the line on the detergent cup turns out to be somewhere else, you can safely assume it has nothing much to do with the capacity of your washing machine, and ignore it. When clothes are done washing, should they have the  You dont even need to put it in the washer dryer. Let the mask soak in hot soapy water  laundry soap for twenty minutes. Rinse thoroughly.

Will putting a cloth mask in the washer and dryer kill off COVID19? How often should you wear clothes between washes? Laundry  What's the best temperature to wash clothes at 30 or 40degrees? What detergent do you use to wash your clothes and why? If you put too much detergent into a load of laundry, is immediately washing the clothes again without any detergent a proper way to remove excess detergent? Yes, there is such a thing as overloading a washing machine as well as a drying machine. There should be plenty of room for the clothes to move about while in the washer, in order for the clothes to come out clean. If the clothes are packed in too tightly, they wont come out clean, and they may have detergent splotches on them, because the water and detergent were not able to combine and mix properly. The most harmful effect of packing in too many clothes into a washer or dryer is the additional stress it places on the belts and motor of the machine. You will wear out your machine prematurely. Can you put too many clothes in a washing machine? We bought a LG fully automatic front loading washing machine a few months ago. It has a default setting of cotton clothes and the time set by the program display is 1 hr and 30 mins. When the clothes are too many, the machine selects a different program and shows the time as 3 hours We immediately switch off the machine, open the front door and take off a few clothes and then the problem is solved. The default program comes on How do you know if you put too many clothes in the washing machine? If the clothes are soaking wet and not dirty, you still need to put them inside the washer for a quick spin. Set the washers timer on spin only. This will ring out excess water. Depending on your washer, it may spray rinse water while it spins. Try to advance the dial beyond that point. Some washers have a option button to spin and drain only. Use this option instead. If the clothes are damp or slightly wet, there would be no need to spin dry. Just put them in the dryer or hang dry If i have soaking wet clothes can I put them back in the washer or put them in the dryer? Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? Yes. The washer cant clean the clothes well if it is over loaded. Then it wont rinse the clothes well leaving soap residue. People who overload the washer probably use too much laundry detergent too. Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? Overloading a washer might or might not make dirty clothes dirtier. If there are particularly soiled clothes mixed in with cleaner ones, the dirty water will spread thru all the clothes  not be adequately rinsed bc the machine is packed too tightly, thus making the cleaner clothes dirtier, tho the dirtier ones might be slightly cleaner dirt might be spread out. But overloading a machine can ruin it, esp if its overloaded repeatedly, causing excessive wear to the machine. Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? Yes, as it takes only one dirty or smelly item to spread the grime to all the laundry. A washing machine needs water, detergent, and motion to clean laundry. There needs to be room for the items to move freely and to get rinsed properly for the load to get clean. The detergent and dirt which wasnt washed out will stick to the clothes and the inside of the washing machine. Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? There are no scientific guidelines that when the mold will grow on the laundry. All it depends, relative humidity, the condition of the clothes if there is only one garment which is heavily contaminated with mold spores, it may spoil the whole load. The following example will explain the level of contamination in the environment has a significant impact on the growth of mold on the uncontaminated things.  In my working career, I have worked in one cheese plant which was extremely contaminated with the mold spores, and the government closed it. I was hired to work with the possibility of getting the plant opened. The first day, when I saw the condition of the place, I hold my head and sit there, made a coffee, the next day when went to work there, there was a thick layer black mold floating on the coffee cup. Yes, mold grows in a coffee cup if it stays unwashed however, to become a thick layer overnight surprised me. The point of this small story was to explain the effect of level of contamination in the environment on the mold growth in your washer on the damp laundry. I hope it helps. There is not any battle with molds and bacteria that I have fought and lost. With best regards. Sam Arora, M.Sc. Food Science, U of Guelph, Canada, M.Sc. Dairy Science, U of Punjab, India How long is too long to leave clothes in the washer before moving them to the dryer? How long can you leave laundry in the washer before it starts to get moldy? Yes. You shouldnt pack the clothes in there so tightly they cant move. The agitation of the clothes while the drum rotates along with the detergent is what cleans the clothes. If the clothes are so tightly packed they cant move, you make the washing inefficient at best and just contaminate each other at worst. Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? it wont make them more unclean but they might still be dirty and have stains still on them because when too many clothes are stuffed in the machine the water and the detergent cant get to clean them properly and the machine is slower Could putting too many clothes in a washer actually make them more unclean than before? more than about twothirds full. One third to one half would be better, for a top loading washer. Oddly enough, a front loader can be almost full How many clothes are too much for a washer? Yes. Because they will be so twisted up they won't get enough suds or a good wash with the soap  water. It will be too tight. Also you risk tears in the materials for the same reason.

It's only used once or twice a month at a lake cabin. Why is my refrigerator not as cold as it used to be? How do you level a refrigerator? How does a refrigerator cool? Is it okay to tilt my fridge an inch to make the fridge door automatically close? Warm soapy water. Most people don't realize that soap is naturally bacteriacidal, and it doesn't have to say antibacterial on the label. In fact, ones that do so cause bacterial resistant strains to develop and ordinary soaps, which kill bacteria even better, DON'T cause resistant strains to develop. Why? Antibiotics work not by immediately destroying the bacterium, but by interfering with some part of its metabolic processes. Since bacteria are different types of cells than human cells, that interference wouldn't be expected to damage the surrounding human cells in a person's body. Antibiotics are safe to take internally, without killing the patient. Antiseptics, cannot be used internally, because they rip open cell walls. Any cell walls, yours, bacteria's, plants, animals, etc. They kill. So the cells aren't alive to develop resistance. Soaps are naturally antiseptic, and have been tinkered with for centuries to be less harsh in human skin if rinsed off, but still would be deadly if taken internally. But, because they don't allow the pathogens to develop resistance, soap and water is the cheapest and best disinfectant we have. So wash your fridge I side and out using hot soapy water, then rinse with fresh water with a different clean cloth, then dry with a clean towel. Throw all three into the wash before you use them again. For surfaces in the house that water isn't a good idea for wood, painted plaster walls, etc use a commercial disinfectant safe for that surface. Be sure to leave it on for the count if time the label tells you to, so it has enough time to tip up those bacterial cell walls and virus protein sheaths and do its job properly. Please don't start using lots of antibacterial soap products, they allow the viruses and bacteria to live for a time, don't instantly kill, so the possibility of the pathogen developing resistance is very real, and would make the current pandemic potentially much worse. It could mean we find a vaccine or means to treat but then there's a new version those don't work on. Be safe everyone. How do I clean out a refrigerator?

151,My mom thinks that her house being cleaned is more important than me doing my work Do you agree with her,"If you are earning money and paying rent to your mom, I think all you need to be doing is cleaning up after yourself, doing your own laundry, and helping with meals  that is cooking and washing up afterwards. Any bathroom you use you should at least help keep clean. That is the obligation of any room mate. Then it would be nice if you ran the vacuum cleaner over the floors occasionally. It is a task you could share with your mom. She does it one week  and you do it the next. If you are in school and your studies are so difficult that every minute is taken up studying, I think you still can do all of these tasks, with perhaps letting your mom do your laundry and the vacuuming. Your focus and goal is to get to a place where you can earn a good living. Your mom should be in full agreement with that. We all have obligations that help us all get along with our daily lives. These are yours. No one on this planet is your servant, including your mom. So, pick up after yourself, keep your room clean, or at least your side of the room clean and help in the kitchen  it is the least you can do. My mom thinks that her house being cleaned is more important than me doing my work. Do you agree with her? These past years I wasnt the best at helping mom in the kitchen, bringing things to her and when it came to cleaning I would usually do it with wining. I want to change but I am scared that my mom will catch up and start to use me. What should I do? My motherinlaw announced she is coming over to clean our house. I hear cause she thinks I am a terrible housekeeper. What do I do? Mom is making me clean my room instead of doing my 30 missing assignments that she's been screaming at me to do. We have 8 does of school left and I need to get it done. How can I explain to her that there are more important things than a tidy room? What should you do if you allowed someone to live with you rentfree if they clean the house but after moving in they rarely clean? Every time I invite the family over, my mother shows up early and claims she is here to clean up the place a little before everyone else comes over. The house is clean already. What should I do about this? To quote Julie LythcottHaims, former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and author of   LythcottHaims believes kids raised on chores go on to become employees who collaborate well with their coworkers, are more empathetic because they know firsthand what struggling looks like, and are able to take on tasks independently. She bases this on the Harvard Grant Study, the longest longitudinal study ever conducted.  Business Insider, May 6, 2016 Suck it up, Buttercup. Your mom is doing you and your sister a favor by teaching you how to be adults instead of condemning you to lives of perpetual entitled childhood. I am also doing my son this same favor. He is learning how to do dishes and laundry. I will also teach him how to change a tire and service his own car. Weve all run into adults in our lives who acted as if living spaces just take care of themselves, food grows in the refrigerator and that it is always someone elses job to clean up after them. I shared a dorm bathroom and kitchen though thankfully not a room with some of them in college and Ive known a few. These people are a pain. To quote comedian Rita Rutner, They live like bears with furniture. Dont be one of these people. On the other hand, I had a flatmate once who had a very different schedule than I did. I worked 830 to 5 and she worked mornings and evenings in a beforeand afterschool daycare. Id come home and find that someone had vacuumed or straightened the living room. It was like living with the good fairy. My husband had a tenant once who just enjoyed doing home repairs. He is now a professional woodworker and is, coincidentally, the person who introduced us. He also liked to get up early, make coffee and go out for doughnuts which he would leave in the kitchen to share. It was like living with the elves from The Elves and the Shoemaker. These people are wonderful. They are also about as rare as fairies and elves. You need to learn to take care of yourself and your own space sometime. Like most things, the sooner you learn, the better. Thats just life. I am male. Why does my mom expect me to clean the house when she and my sister can do it perfectly fine themselves? Why does my mom expect me to clean the house when she and my sister can do it perfectly fine themselves? I happen to be partial to Galvanize, but wholly concur with Robertos advice. nBoth Metis and Galvanize run highly respected programs and it really comes down to what is right for you. Here are  1. Who else is the program admitting? A welldesigned program will require an application, skill evaluation and interviews, to ensure that every student is set up to succeed in the program. If a bootcamp is ready to take your credit card number without any questions upfront, theyre more interested in their bottom line than in your education. 2. How do they calculate their placement numbers? Sure, 99 placements rate sounds good, but whats really behind that number? Skyhigh placement percentages can be meaningless, depending on how theyre calculated. Theres no standard industry definition of employed  does it include graduates who got a job unrelated to their new field? Lessthanideal freelance and parttime gigs? Dig into the data. After all, youre on your way to becoming a data scientist 3. How long does the program last? Start a new career in tech in six weeks Sounds too good to be true, and thats probably because it is. Coding,  4. Outside of class, what does this program offer? Will your bootcamp send you off with nothing more than a certificate and a pat on the back? The right program doesnt just offer training, it provides the connections for you to break into your new field. Whether its hiring events, access to a network of industry heavyhitters or ongoing assistance with your resume, applications and interviews, the best bootcamps offer a range of resources to get you hired. Beyond career services, what does your campus offer? Will you be stuck in a windowless cube all day, or surrounded by people eager to innovate and collaborate? While some bootcamps cultivate a community of likeminded learners, other leave you adrift on your own. Try to get a sense of the daytoday before you commit to spending six months on campus  its worth the research. I am deciding between attending the Galvanize Data Science bootcamp and the Metis Data Science bootcamp. Which should I choose? My ex motherinlaw was like this. She was a dragonlady. Through 2 pregnancies, she would come over and complain about everything. Once, I cleaned the entire house. Detailed it inside and out. The bathroom was spotless. Kitchen immaculate. There wasn't a speck of dust anywhere. The car got washed and vacuumed. I moved all of the furniture in the living room, just to vacuum under it. I even pressure washed the terrace. When she showed up, she didn't comment on anything. She walked through the house, out the back door, across the terrace and into the back yard directly to the biggest tree we had. She pointed at the ground under the tree, and started complaining about the amount of dead leaves under this tree. And presenting an image of 'decency to our neighbors. I shit you not.  I kinda blew up at her. I pointed out that I work overtime, and took care of her pregnant daughter, and defied her to find something in the house that needed to be cleaned. She was cool after that. For almost 24 hours. Then she stated bitching and moaning again. I told her I was done. I told her if she wanted something done, she could feel free to do it. And she did often. And often I would out my feet up. But this strategy might not be the best. I kinda alienated her. But to be perfectly fair and honest, she had a screw loose. Still does. Really. She just has no chill. The next time I was at her house, though, I started bitching about every speck of dirt, dust and coven that I could find. I flew off the handle about the 'decency of the situation and what the neighbors would think. She got the point, but it didn't change anything. I'm happy to not be in that family anymore. My best advice would be to talk about it openly. Let them know that you don't hold their misconceived level of standards as realistic. Best of luck. My wife's family is house proud. When they visit, they want to clean our house despite my objection. Am I right to be upset? Become an expert at quickly decluttering and organizing a room and then quickly cleaning it. The better you get at cleaning, the more youll enjoy it and the faster it will become. the more often you clean, the easier it will be. Your mom will appreciate you, and youll have that skill the rest of your life. After all, when youre an adult an live alone, your home will only be nice if you clean it regularly. Best to turn on some music, get moving, and get it done. Try taking big boxes and laundry baskets to each room and filling one with trash, another with things to keep an put away, and another with things to give away. Take the same three boxes to each room and keep filling them. When you are done, put the trash in a trash bag, put the donations into the car in bags, and sort the items to keep by rooms and put them away in the rooms where they go. Then, dust each room thoroughly. Shine each rooms glass or smooth surfaces. Go through the house vacuuming everything that can be vacuumed. Then clean the hard floor surfaces thoroughly. Take out the trash from each room. Wash the throw rugs and towels. clean the rest of the bathroom. Clean the kitchen. Put back the towels and throw rugs. Get the laundry sorted and started. Strip the beds and put fresh sheets on if you have extras or do the sheets next so you can remake the beds. Keep at it. You might as well clean the doorknobs and light switches an the walls and woodwork around them and then go over the fronts of the kitchen cabinets. That was so much work that youll never want to let it get that behind again. So, do it again next week so its easy and fast. I know your mom probably didnt mean for you to do all that at one try. But, if you get a system, you can do more than you think. So, list what you really need to do and do that systematically and well. The next time it will be easier. Get good at it and then charge neighbors 20 an hour using their supplies. For two hours work, you get forty dollars cash. That would be handy wouldnt it? But, you need to be good at it to get paid to do it. So, practice on your home. Its a skill that will always make you money if you need it. My mom wants me to clean the house and I dont feel like it. What should I do? What happens when mother cleans your room? My mom asked me to move in and save her house. I did and have been cleaning up. Now, she is telling me she is about 10,000 behind. I'm thinking we can be evicted at any moment. Should I give up on the house and move out? How can I stop my mom from throwing away my stuff, when she is  How did you take care of the house when your mom got sick for a few weeks or even months? Should I make my child clean up? Why should she? Why does every child expect the mother to do all activities at home? Is she an unpaid servantmaid? Is there no role for all others at home to keep the house clean? It is nothing but mean to expect everything done by the momshe is not a machine, she is like you and memore you maintain her in shape, she would be happy to serve. Moreover, it depends on the wish and will of the kidIt may be the strategy of the mother to let the kid know the importance of workIf the mother is not well and can not work, it is imperative for all at home to cooperate and contribute their bestcleaning is a lovable work at home in any casea mother's work is normally wellknit and an efficient mother manages time better than all others at homesomething will be happening at the kitchen during which time she does a bit of cleaning ..when washing machine is on, she does something else during the timea mother's job is very envious and only blessed are those who train their kids in the same way Today mothers manage office and home more deftly than the supposed to be betterhalveson the other hand, the next gen is not inclined to do all the works by themselves..they get developed as so called smart managers. .with half of the size in family and double the size of home.. one order and zomato or dominos deliversone order and maids can be hired for each jobyet, for a performing mother, her absence counts more emotionally than physically Next gen ma is simply different and preparing to face anything is better than all other options.Why cleaning alone, a host of the subset of activities she does to make the home look like a home PS This is not for those lazy brats who by fate became mothers and manage to spend most of the time watching TV, handset and remain inseparable from bed. If a mother doesnt work and stays at home all day, should her kids do the cleaning or should she? I would find out the cause. Has she been like this all along? Or is this a recent thing? Is she doing it on purpose or being passiveaggressive? Has her job changed where she is overwhelmed with the new schedule and doesnt have time? Maybe shes going thru some personal stuff thats affecting her responsibilities. If shes going thru a crisis or life change, try to have all your family members come up with a plan to help her out. Maybe designate a room or two for each person so that they have ownership of that space. Maybe even have contests to aee who could clean their space the fastest. Make it fun somehow. I dont know how old you are but if you have enough initiative to post on Quora, youre old enough to take charge for a while. This is your chance to make a plan and a difference. The cleaning part is easy but if your mom is exhibiting this behavior from some sort of stress or depression, try to get the older members of your family involved. Your grandparents or aunts and uncles may help. If, however, you and your siblings are not contributing to the household chores and expect mom to clean up after your messes after you reach the age of 9 or 10, it sounds like a boycott. At some point, you and your siblings must make changes either way. You dont have to do everything all at once. But starting changes little by little will make a difference. Sometimes kids have to become the parents. I had to grow up parenting my own parents, too but for other reasons. What can I do if my mom doesn't clean the house? Answering here is a mom who is always cleaning. When my son was in second grade, he presented me with a Mothers Day sort of poem listing sweeping as one of the main thing moms do  Does your mom give you specific chores, or just casually asks you to clean? If they arent unreasonable, you can just do your chores. Mostly, it is good to get into the habit of picking up after yourself. You dont have to leave a place better than you found it necessarily, but dont leave it looking worse. My son doesnt yet sleep in his own room, but once he does, I will expect at least a minimal standard of cleanliness no old food and dirty dishes, no wet clothes and towels growing mold. Other than that, itll be his room. Just do your part, and say something if you think its too much?  It may be negotiable. I dont expect others to have my pretty high standards of cleanliness. My mom always wants me to clean, Im not a slob or anything but what should I do? My mom thinks that her house being cleaned is more important than me doing my work. Do you agree with her?"

155,What is something you wash in your dishwasher that you are fairly confident no one else does,"I have two sets of stainless steel throwing knives that get quite dirty especially in the spiring and autumn. My dishwasher and a cascade platinum pack later and these little babies will be sterilized and wiped of my fingerprints and DNA. Then the hunt can begin in full.  ,  This disgusting amount of filth and germs comes from just one hour of practice and it is well below freezing thus inhibiting much of the mud associated with the warmer days. Here are my blades of flying death just prior to being cleaned  ,   ,  Only cascade cares about your anonymity. Tide pods contain nanoregistration particles that can tie your purchase of them to any crimes. Do not use tide pods prior to any criminal activity. As a former assassin I can speak of this with knowledge. And before you get upset about assassinations. I ONLY ever did it for ideological reasons NEVER for money or power. 7 times I saved the planet and or moon. 4 times I have assassinated someone to protect the solar system. And two times I saved the entire known multiverses by killing an enetity if you can call a swarm of sentient virsuses operating with a hive mind an enetity. Had to bust out the old garbage thrower on that one too. So you are welcome. So update on the knives coming soon. When the cycle ends that is.  ,  Hope this helps Godspeed What is something you wash in your dishwasher that you are fairly confident no one else does? Can you put shoes in the dishwasher? Is a dishwasher more energysaving than washing dishes warm 3 times a day? Will opening the dishwasher once it is finished help the dishes dry quicker? How can I keep my dishwasher smelling fresh in between loads? Are dishwashers worth the hassle? Handwashing is terribly inefficient when it comes to the use of water and the energy used to heat that water. You cannot even fill one side of a sink with the water used by a dishwasher. In fact you probably couldnt even fill the sink half full. A modern dishwasher averages about four to eight gallons of water per load, depending on brand. A dishwasher is not arguably faster, it IS faster because you arent doing the dishes. The time required to tilt off scraps and place them in the machine is only a fraction of what it would take to do the dishes by hand. The idea is time saved by the human. The time the dishwasher takes to do the dishes is irrelevant because the human can be doing something else during this time. If you want to make an accurate comparison you have to compare the time to load the dishwasher with the time it would take to hand wash. For both of these are what consume human labor. So the dishwasher wins in less energy use, less resource usage and less human labor. PLUS, dishes washed by a dishwasher are cleaner than can be gotten by hand. Hand washing can leave an invisible grease layer on dishes, and hand washing is much less sanitary. So from the viewpoint of human effort saved, being more ecologically sound to our environment, and more sanitary, the dishwasher wins over hand washing every time. Why do so many people use dishwashers when it's arguably faster and more efficient to hand wash dishes?

Keyboards last several years but they get crumbs and stuff down between the keys, so I put it in the top rack, keys down, and it comes out sparkling clean. A friend of mine had trouble with her keyboard so I suggested this. I told her to shake out as much water as she could, then just let it airdry. That evening she tried to use the keyboard but it didnt work well. So she went to Best Buy to buy another one. She told the salesman shed put her KB in the dishwasher and the joke went all around the store. Can you believe what this dumb lady did? She put her keyboard in the DISHWASHER Ha ha ha When she came back with her new KB, she tried the old one. It had dried out by now and it worked perfectly again. What is something you wash in your dishwasher that you are fairly confident no one else does? I have actually done exactly this and the only problem is vibration damaging items in the dishwasher but if you do not use the washer with the dishwasher loaded you will be fine. I would also add an airbreak onto the outlet hose of the dishwasher or extend a stand pipe up high behind the dishwasher to prevent siphoning as the outlet connection now will most likely be well below the dishwasher in normal configuration.

By the time you have removed every scrap and rinsed the dishs for the dishwasher so not to clog it up you may as well have washed and rinsed it under very hot water and job done, they dry themselves. Instead you scrape, rinse, load, wait over an hour and then unload. Pointless? They are not for me anymore as too time consuming but everyone to their own.

How much time does a dishwasher wash dishes? I use liquid detergent in my washing machine, but there is a slot attached to it that has holes in it, for a prewash. Dishwashers almost always will rinse the contents once before washing to help remove excess remnants and oils that may be left on things, some even have sensors to measure how dirty the dishes are and this step is a test to decide how much extra work for it to do on other cycles to effectively clean the dishes. You dont just throw it in, as it would dissolve in that first rinse cycle and wash most of the soap away. When you use a dishwasher, why do you have to put the washing tablet in that special slot instead of just putting it in with the dishes?

What biggest lesson give you life? What is the biggest lesson that life has taught you? There is something I regret not doing, today 9th April 2019. Before going into this story, let me give you some back story Currently, I'm in my 6th semester. I had a female friend, A, who I knew from the 1st semester. We had grown very close to each other over time. So close that she was someone in front of whom I could be completely myself without being judged and she used to consider me her human diary. She used to tell me everything..her bad breakups, about her friends and family, everything. We were each other's safe space. Now, what happened was last year in August, she went on an industrial visit with her classmates we are in different departments. Around that time, I started noticing that a new guy was appearing in her social media. I was like.. nice, she's got a new boyfriend  but was also disappointed that she didn't tell me firstthat I had to know it from her social media. Still it was fine by me as she was happy. Now, obviously, she was smitten with him but after she came back from industrial visit, we hardly talked. Our conversations were never the same as before. I tried to initiate any conversation but it just wouldn't happen. Still, I was fine. I know what happens during the honeymoon period. So, okay. Now, I tried staying okay but gradually I started getting angry at both of them. Him, for stealing away my friend and her, for not making any effort to talk to me. Now, things came to a head for me on my birthday. On the eve of my birthday, I told her to keep her afternoon free because I would treating her and my friends at a restaurant. At first she didn't understand why but after sometime she understood why. After a couple of hours of this happening, she messaged me asking whether she could bring someone to meet me at the restaurant. I point blank told her no as I wanted that lunch to be about meI didn't tell her this and also told her that I knew she was talking about her new boyfriend. She agreed. Next day, when I reached there with my friends, I saw her boyfriend's bike. Immediately I knew that she did bring him here, despite me telling her no. After going in, she introduced me to him, I acted my courteous best and then started looking for our table. She saw him off and then joined us. But by then I was irritated and pissed off. While ordering, she understood this and asked me what was wrong with me but I didn't tell her at that time as I didn't want the mood to get spoiled. I just let that go and enjoyed my birthday lunch. Now over time our conversation has lessened to such an extent that we don't even tag each other in Avengers related stuff we both are huge Marvel fans. Any long conversation is out of the question. Even if we see each other in campus, it's Hi, I'm late for class, Bye. But since all that, I have gradually made peace with the fact that we may never go back to being such good friends. Now, let's jump to today. Today, in the morning, I was in line for the lift to go to my class when I saw a girl talking to a security guard who was managing the lines. Immediately I knew it was her. I caught bits of her conversation with the guard and understood that she wanted the guard to hold some assignment of her bf's so that her bf could come and pick it up. I could clearly see that she was agitated as she was also getting late for her class but this was important to her PS she hadn't seen me there.I thought of approaching her and holding the assignment for her bf, so that she could go to her class assured that the assignment will be in safe hands and will eventually reach her bf. But, I did not do so. My ego just wouldn't let me. So I let it pass. But as soon as I climbed into the lift, I was filled with regret. Maybe if I had done that, it would have been the spark to rekindle our friendship. Maybe, she would have missed me and our friendship. I don't know exactly what would have happened, but I do regret not helping out a dear friend just because I was angry at her. This forced me to make a promise to myself. The next time I get an similar opportunity with regards to anyone, I will be doing so without any hesitation. I cannot let my anger or ego get the better of me. Never ever again. Thank you so much for reading this patiently. Do forgive me if there are any mistakes in there. What is something that you regret doing or not doing? What did you throw out, or get rid of, even though you were advised to keep, then regretted?"

Intrinsic value for most high quality firearms would be greater than any negatives from nominal wear .. there is also a measure of provenance , history that adds to the market  everything is taken into consideration . ..often slight wear is expected .

As a teenager, my room tends to be messy. How do I keep a good cleaning habit? Why won't my adult son clean his room? My son is 25 years old. The floor of his room his covered with clothing, food waste, trash, etc. I saw a cockroach in his room several times. He has a dresser and a closet, neither of which he uses. How important is it to make children and teens keep their rooms clean? I have a stepson. I met him when he was 10. Early on I quickly realized how spoiled he is. His parents are divorced and they all do everything for him to compensate for a broken family, somehow. So, when I became part of his life, I put work schedule at home right away. Each of us take turns on doing dishes, cleaning, doing laundry and even cooking. Rightfully, as he is still young I only put him on cooking duty once a week. I am there teaching him new recipes and teaching him how to wash dishes efficiently. We just recently acquired dishwasher, so we hand wash everything before. As he get older I added more choires for him. At 12, I gave him a choice to either do laundry with us twice a week or he can do his own laundry. He figured out that doing laundry for everybody includes rugs, curtains, bedsheets and etc. is too much. So, he chose doing his own laundry. I changed the schedule again, and he now have more responsibilities. Added to it is the responsibility to keep his room clean. I routinely check every day and tell him off if it is messy. I indoctrinate him to start a productive day by fixing the bed before leaving for school. At 14 my son is now independent. He goes to gym at 6am everyday, make his own breakfast, and be in school at 900. He do his laundry once a week, he cleaned our staircase, help around in the garden, cook dinner, do dishes on weekends and clean the car. He also starts dating and he kept everything tidy to impress the girls. Mind you, there was a lot of long talks and even nagging when he was 11, but the key is consistency. After 2 years of consistent schedule and expectations, he start taking it as his new normal. You see, giving responsibilities to kids start when they are young. We make our son understand that to be happy is not about living life as one pleases, but having responsibilities and meaning. With him having responsibilities, he is happier. Though, I still hear occasional complaints and murmuring that I am the strictest Filipina mom he ever met.  My 14yearold daughter won't clean her room. I can't fight with her every day. What should I do? My mom wont let me clean her room and theres not even a single space to even walk around her room at all. Im only 14 and I usually clean my surroundings pretty often. What should I do?"

But I would be not so obsessed with that fear of germs. They are everywhere anyway. Just basic hygiene should be enough like washing your hands afterwards. Don't dismiss the toilet brush, as there is nothing more frustrating to find a dirty toilet. When I close the lid before flushing the toilet, should I clean it again because whatever is in the toilet came on the seat? I am freaking out now that I think about it. What is the use of a toilet seat? Pretty much everyone in my family is used to flushing with the toilet seat up and never thought about the germs, I told them but they won't listen. Should I worry when using the bathroom? It never caused me harm What's the use of a toilet seat? Why does jjggling the flush lever on a running toilet fix it? Why does jiggling the handle of a flush toilet cause it to quiet down? If the toilet leaks only when you flush, Im going to guess that its leaking around the base of the toilet.nYour wax seal is probably bad. This seal sits between your closet flange and the hole at the bottom of the toilet where the waste water exits. It creates a water tight barrier between the toilet and the drainage system.nOver time, this wax ring can deteriorate.nReplacing it is fairly simple.nTurn the toilets water supply line off Disconnect the supply line from the toilet Flush the toilet and sponge out the rest of the water Loosen the nuts on the flange bolts. Theyre the two bolts that hold the toilet to the floor Pick the toilet up and move it off to the side Scrape the old wax ring off the flange and the bottom of the toilet Now place the toilet back onto the closet flange without a wax ring. See if the toilet rocks side to side or front to back. This can cause leaks at the base of a toilet because wax rings do not have memory. Its important to install a toilet on a level floor. If the toilet rocks in any direction, take note of the direction. Remove toilet from bolts and place the wax ring on the bottom of the toilet. Carefully, lower the toilet back onto the flange bolts taking caution to lower the toilet down evenly until it is resting on the floor. Now would be the time to shim any uneven areas to prevent toilet rocking. Tighten the nuts onto the bolts. Firm but not too tight or you could crack the porcelain. Connect the water line back to the toilet and youre in business There are a bunch of Youtube videos that show how to do this, as well. Why is my toilet leaking every time I flush it? There are so many different types of hardware that stop the flow of water from the tank into the toilet bowl, without knowing whats inside the tank, it is quite impossible to reply accurately. But in general, if your tank was made and installed in the last century, then it is a safe bet there will be a rubber stopper of some kind that, after flushing, this rubber thing will seal the opening between the tank and the bowl and refilling starts again. If this is the case, then the rubber ball, seal contraption is not sitting properly where it should. Whether there is calcification, rust or debris or corrosion that is preventing the seal to function properly. Open the tank cover, if you are handy, and feel around, if you can, and see why this is happening.Maybe the seal or the rubber ball  seal is bad. Clean the area where the seal sits, if you can reach it, using steelwool or similar. The button that you push is only an actuator to tell the tank to go ahead and flush, it does not control the flow of water, in most cases. That is done by a float system, an arm, with a ball that pushes on the valves to stop letting water in once the preset level is reached. Below the botton, there must a lever, a hook and another contraption to lift that seal I wrote about earlier. If the button is in the middle of the tank lid, then you have your work cutout for you. The lid is heavy and there is a few pieces of plastic right below the button. Make sure you are fit to handle the disassembling. You will have to put the system back together. Or better yet, depending on where you live, go to a hardware store or a plumbing supply and see if they still have similar toilets as yours. Learn how it is put together. Read the instructions or ask for help and if all fails, call a plumber . My toilet flush button feels  When I close the lid before flushing the toilet, should I clean it again because whatever is in the toilet came on the seat? I am freaking out now that I think about it."

208,How often should cars be washed,"Some people wash their cars very frequently  not, because they have to, but because they actually enjoy it. From your question, I think one can rule out that you belong to this group. You probably view washing your car as a necessary nuisance. So, looking at it from a perspective of necessities, here is what I can tell you If your car serves  If you just want to increase the lifespan of your car by giving it proper care, then you wont have to wash it every week. But you should also not neglect it for half a year, and then give it premium treatment to make up for it. Dust and grime over time build up, and develop acids that can seriously damage your car, and lead to rusty spots, that will be expensive to repair. A good intervall is around once a month, latest point once every two months all assuming daily use.

How do car dealerships wash cars so clean without the sophisticated equipment that car washes have? About once a week in dry weather. A chain of automatic car washes in Texas and California provides unlimited visits for about a dollar a day. They are building several new locations every year, and their ubiquity is convenient for me, as my graphics and print clients are located over an area of half a dozen counties. Their partialrecycled water process supposedly uses only 10 gallons of water per wash, versus 100 gallons in our home driveways. Californians have not only been wasting money we dont have on fads and fantasies, we ship water away from here in the North to keep those fiftyfoot fountain sprays in the South aspraying. The Journal did a frontpage feature a few years ago on a German engineering guy over there obsessing over perfecting the automated wash, so that there are no paint swirls or broken glass, design that requires little inline maintenance. This TexasCalifornia chain spends effectively on brandname hydrophobic wash and rinse chemicals. Avoiding tearing off verticalpark back wiper arms here? Not so good. I watched three more arms get torn off and slapped against the right wall. After the chain paid for the first one, I simply removed them. I make sure the rear cargo door windows are wellRainXed, in addition to the chains dose. To have petulantly insisted on constant reimbursement would have been shamefully unrealistic, seems like. Their system works just fine being nearly perfect. How often do you get your car washed? How often do you take your vehicle to a car wash? That would depend on where you life and how clean you wish the car to be at any given time. In the summer time i wash the cars every 2 weeks maybe or 4, depends on weather and usage. The main thing is to protect it with a wax or now recently available ceramic coating. Also washing the car often might be not the best idea, especially if you do it incorrectly. The best way is a 2 bucket system one for rinsing and other for new soap, microfiber wash mitten and some foaming soap, check out Ammo NYC on youtube, that is the most professional wash available. and rather than drying the car off with a towel, drive it around the block and dump the towel on the remaining water, not dragging it over the paint surface, decreasing risk of scratching is what all this is about. Ceramic coating will handle a lot more washing than normal wax, if i would life in a hotter climate i would take the car once a year to a pro. detailer shop, first time do paint correction remove all visible scratches with polishing and than every year for touch up coating of ceramic.  ,  Here you can see why its not good to constantly wash the car, with the incorrect technique, it will leave these swirls in the paint, and make it look dull   matte. You can have them removed and than coated with ceramic, it will last for over a year in some climates in real use, not what it claims on the box. Than wash it with correct method and it will look like the black mirror finish as i accomplished on this Mercedes Benz 500E W124 . How often do you get your car washed? About once a year on average. I usually do it in May or early June, after all of the snow has melted and the roads have been cleaned of sand and salt. I park my car outdoors all year, and usually Mother Nature in the form of rain does the job at most other times. There isnt an overabundance of sunshine where I live and the region is heavily forested, so solar aging of the interior upholstery and exterior paint job is minimal to imperceptible around here. Also, it feels really weird to say this, but modern cars dont rust. No, I dont mean that they dont rust out or rust through, I mean they dont rust, period. I have been driving for over 40 years, and in most of that time it was common and expected to see cars on the road with at least some visible rot if they were at least four years old. I live in snow country, after all. But starting around 12 years ago, that phenomenon became less and less frequent, and now it is rather rare. My 2013 Kia Soul, for instance, has weathered five Northeastern US winters and six summers, parked outdoors all day and all night on at least 360 days each year, and it doesnt have a spot of rust on it. I cant explain it, but I used to see a whole range of scruffylooking cars and pickup trucks around town, out on the highway, and back in the taiga every day, but in the past decade they have all but disappeared. I dont do anything special to my car. I dont even bother to dry it after its annual washing, and the only wax it ever gets is the liquid kind sprayed on it at the car wash. It hasnt been in any fender benders or collisions. Everything on it is still solid and tight. How often do you get your car washed? How much do you tip the car wash guy? Is getting a super deluxe car wash rather than a regular one worth the extra money? Why is it better to wash your car by auto wash? Why is it good to keep your car washed all the time? Is there such a thing as washing your car too much? If youre leasing the car I would do it once a year and then just before you take it back in at the end of the lease. If you bought a new car a complete detail once a year is good if you want to maintain its likenew look. However, if you bought a new lowend car dont bother, just do it yourself, but if you have a highend car then you should have it professionally done. Even if you take the car in to have detailed you should do a home job on it by using quick spray on wax between detailing. Of course, steam cleaning the engine is important for classic cars to look their best my engines were so clean you could eat off of them With my cars, since I buy them used and theyre not special highend cars I do the detailing myself, it takes about a good part of a 4th of a day. I use to get really obsessed with my classic cars, which I did the detailing myself, those would take the entire day to do correctly, but with modern cars, I just use fast sprayon liquid wax, and I may do that 4 times a year, but Ill run the car through a car wash first, then go home and spray wax it. I also rarely have the engine steamed cleaned unless it looks bad to me, and that could be once or twice in its lifetime. If you decide not to go nuts, thats fine too especially for lowerend cars, just take it to the car wash and be done with it. The only time you would want to have a lowend car detailed is when you are ready to sell it. How often do you get your car washed? How often should you detail your car? Im not a professional however Ive owned many vehicles. It depends on where you live, whether it is kept mostly outside or inside, the kind of roads you encounter while driving, and the color of your vehicle. There are probably other factors but these are prominent to me as a car owner. if you live near any salt water, you will need to get your vehicle washed about every ten days, two weeks at the most. Salt and sand can destroy the finish if not removed. In places that are windy and dusty, wash as needed. In areas subject to hail, wash after a storm clears in order to check for hail damage. if you drive in mud, sand, pebbles, tar, wash as soon as you are able and again use the opportunity to inspect for dents or damages. if your car is in a garage or carport when you are at home and or at work, you wont have to wash it as much if it is constantly exposed to the elements. Of course dark finishes must be washed more often than white or neutral colors. If you have had your car wrapped, check with the company to see if there are special instructions A simple trick is  if your windows are dirty, its time to wash your car. How often do you get your car washed? How often should I wash my car? Depends on where you live. Here in Wisconsin, I wash my car a lot throughout the Winter because of all the salt on the roads. The salt promotes rusting which is why it is a good idea to get it off as soon as the weather permits 15 degrees at minimum if you have a garage and are willing to do some hand drying otherwise 30 degrees at minimum. In warmer temperatures, washing is only required when the vehicle gets dirty. However if you wash too much it can damage the vehicle in the areas of paint, weather lining insulation, and glass. So I recommend washing when you have a good amount of visible dirt on your vehicle. Salt is visible even on white vehicles and soil is pretty visible on any color.

I have a black expolice Charger that gets washed when it needs it ,the car still has its tan lines where the police decals were placed while it was in service 9 years past it gets washed when it needs it or when the detail spray and microfiber cloth are overwhelmed by the dirt.I pressure wash it at the local pressure wash place at least twice a month.I also use a California bladesilicone squeegeeto dry it, cause if it is not dried, it leaves rings where every water drop was.Whenever there is dew in the morning I squeegee it and it removes all the dust but also have used a microfiber cloth to the same effect,In between washes it gets detail spray and microfiber cloth treatment almost every day ,this also gives the opportunity to note and evaluate any new damage it may have acquired since the last wash.I also have a red truck that almost never gets washed and a red Miata which is covered when not in use therefore rarely needs a total wash usually just the detail treatment.

Why are bagless vacuum cleaners so horrible, and how did they ever come to be standard? What is better? Upright vacuum cleaners or canister vacuum cleaners? What is the most efficient Vacuum cleaner available in India right now? Do Robotic Vacuum cleaners work better than traditional vacuum cleaners? How? Are robotic vacuum cleaners effective for a big house? TLDR Todays Roombas have marked improvement in durability and functionality. For a larger home, Id merely buy a number of Roombas and schedule them to run when Im not home.  Im surprised at some of these answers saying robot vacuums are useless. They take a long time.  Granted. But personally, I dont care. My latest Roomba has WiFi connection and runs on a schedule when Im not home. Hardest part is remembering to empty the dirt bin from time to time. They dont clean.  Not my experience. Then again I have two dogs and two cats. When my last ex moved out she didnt work and generally kept up on the house, within two weeks I noticed fur tumbleweeds rolling about on the floor. Oops, guess I need to start vacuuming. Instead I bought a Roomba and havent seen a tumbleweed since. It usually runs on a wood floor, carpet takes more battery but wow, it works great on carpet. I forgot the little vacuum can easily go under my bed and well, that hasnt been vacuumed in over a decade. Missed paths.  I can see where people would think this as it does appear to be flowing about randomly. Been a while, but supposedly theres some mine sweeper type algorithm built in. Ill grant that its possible for a spot to be missed, but I havent noticed it and the likelihood of the same spot being missed on the next scheduled run is extremely unlikely. I bought Roombas back when they were new to the market. They worked, but there were issues. The battery lasted at best a year and cost 80 or so to replace. That seemed like a lot for a battery that wouldnt last a year, especially when a complete new Roomba cost a little over 200 at that time. They also seemed to break down in about two years requiring me to toss it or get a new one. Pissed me off that right after buying a battery that one unit died. Also, you had to remove the battery and put it in a charger. Then they came out with a model that had a docking station so it would run a job and then dock itself for a recharge. It worked about half the time, often it couldnt find the docking station. But, it was an improvement, though still the battery didnt last long and the unit failed after a couple years. You also didnt have to remove the battery to charge it. I went several years without a Roomba given the general problems I had. However Decided to purchase again after my last divorce because no one was home to vacuum. Has a docking station and is WiFi enabled. Cool, found I can schedule when it runs, so decided 9am on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Dogs probably arent thrilled, but I dont have to listen to it. It runs for an hour then finds its docking station to recharge. When I get home, its fully charged and I just have to remember to dump the dirt bin from time to time. By the way, its quieter than it was in the past. Still something I dont want to hear for an hour, but I can now hear the TV over it. Not that I run it much when Im home. Rarely, maybe a couple times a year and it runs three times a week it will have issues finding its docking station. They really improved that feature. Usually its because a dog bed managed to migrate in the dock path and it ran out of power trying to dock. Otherwise, its because it got tangled up on a power cord somewhere, etc. With a cell phone app, it tells me metrics. How long it ran in the past several jobs. How the battery is doing. When its time to clean the unit brushes, rollers, etc.. The battery is about to enter its third year and still going quite strong. The unit is showing no signs of failing.  ,  I couldnt be happier with this unit, in fact bought a second one for my cabin, it only runs once a week because Im only there on weekends. I live in a townhouse and dont spend much time on two of four floors. But next time theres a big Amazon sale, I plan on buying more Roombas, one for each floor. I couldnt be much happier with todays Roomba, though itd be great if they made one that did stairs. Are robotic vacuum cleaners effective for a big house?

213,Should you call 911 if you see your neighbor cleaning his handgun as you pass his apartment window,"Only if you want the police to be very unhappy with you. Not in an apartment but I used to live in a house where the neighbor across the street had a major problem with people owning firearms which he also lived in a state where a lot of people do. There were occasions where I would be in the garage cleaning or working on a firearm at my workbench and well if he saw that occurring he did not like it and multiple times called the police, the first couple times were fun, multiple cars with lights on flying up to the end of the driveway. The next couple times the police were considerably less in a rush to respond because I was doing nothing wrong at all. Eventually after the 4th or 5th time this happened took about a year for that I was talking to the responding officer, who happened to be a Sergent. Both he and I were getting frustrated by the waste of time and resources. After that discussion the Sergent went over to the neighbors and informed him for the 4th or 5th time that I was not doing anything illegal and the police could not actually stop me from cleaning a gun on my own property. He went a bit further this time however and informed him that he was clearly noting in the police report that he had informed the neighbor that what I was doing was legal and that continuing to call the police regarding the same thing could result in him being charged with filing false police reports. Not in his report he also informed the guy that I was not overly happy for the hassle and had mentioned suing him for harassment. He made it very clear to him that there were now many police reports of him calling the police and having been informed I was doing nothing wrong, which is a lot of evidence that he was using the police to harass me. That was the last time I had an issue, I think the reality of fun and games turning into criminal charges and a lawsuit must have sunk in and the neighbor just hand to deal with it. Should you call 911 if you see your neighbor cleaning his handgun as you pass his apartment window? A homeless man shot a BB gun at a police station because he hadn't eaten in 4 days and wanted to be arrested. Would the police have helped had he asked for a meal and a place to stay? Would it be wrong of me to shoot my neighbors dog? My neighbor is threatening to shoot my outside dog who barks all night, what should I do? How would a 911 operator handle a call from someone hiding from an intruder in the house? My neighbor shoots guns in the backyard. I'm afraid a stray bullet will hit my family. Should I call the police? Thanks for the a2a. Only if you want your neighbor to tell the officer your calling the police and making false reports to 911 to harass them. The officer will then come to your home to talk to you and request you turn around and put your hands behind your back as they take you into custody. There is no law saying they cannot clean their guns. Calling 911 for bogus stuff like this can result in a full year in prison and or a 1000 dollar fine. Additionally the state can hit you with filing a false report. This can add a felony or misdemeanor charge on your record. Michigan for example can slap you with 20 years in prison if your false report leads to an innocent person being taken into custody and another crime like harassment being present. Its up to the district attourney if they wanna stack or hit you with multiple charges. Your neighbor can also take you to court for civil damages like loss of property should the police confiscate their lawfully owned firearm. Should you call 911 if you see your neighbor cleaning his handgun as you pass his apartment window? In general, probably not. What he does with his own property in his own home is his business. That said, there are some caveats if hes brandishing it e.g., waving it around that might be worth a call. If hes depressed and you worry he intends to harm himself or others, thats definitely worth a call. If he appears intoxicated, or seems to be doing so to threaten someone, thats worth a call. Oh, and if its illegal for him to have a handgun e.g., hes a convicted felon, or handguns are illegal where you live then yeah, the police will DEFINITELY want to know. Basically, if hes doing something that seems like it is intended to appear or is actually dangerous, thats worth a call. If hes just cleaning a possession of his, then no, the police will likely not be pleased to have their time so wasted.

Each year he took it to a machine gun shoot. One day he was preparing for the shoot and the wife kicked him out of the house because of the smelly chemicals. He was cleaning the gun on his front steps and being observed by some of the local junior businessmen. We lived in a transitional neighborhood. Police where summoned.

Generally speaking, the water mist produced has a small particle size, and its particle size is less than 10m.

217,Is it better to use wet wipes for wiping your bum than toilet paper,"I will be quoting my answer from a different question on the same topic, do not use any wet wipes or toilet papers, at least not before this step or explanation QUOTING my original answer I am glad that you asked such a simple question. Unfortunately, not many many people know how to answer correctly, because they still have not mastered the maximum hygiene anally, vaginally or orally. The only way to clean your butthole or you may call it asshole, is by inserting your left middle finger inside your ass after you are done. If you are having a hard time doing that, simply put a drop of olive oil on your left middle finger and insert it gently inside your butthole and clean the inside with it and then try to insert water with your middle finger. If you happen to feel that a shit is still stuck inside then try to push it with but not with your finger. It is the same as if you ask someone that if you drank a cup of coffee and you wash the cup from the outside and you forget the inside, is that enough cleaning? No because there is still some leftovers from the cup inside and not OUTSIDE. The same goes with shitting concept, you will find some left overs after you shit and the inside has to be cleaned GENTLY with a drop of olive oil, no soap or chemical substances then wash it with water using your left middle finger. Note I have said before that a bottle of olive oil 500ml can last for 7 to 9 months with you and even more if you know how to use olive oil drops in a dispenser, you do the economy and let me know if this method is more useful than just wiping or using a paper towel, please forget about using any wiping method before washing the dirt that is inside.

No matter how soft the toilet paper is, you still have to scrub it against your skin. Water is a boon for people who are sensitive to toilet paper. If clean water is used, it reduces the inherent chances of infection that toilet paper causes when one forgets to wipe from front to back. You dont need to spend a fortune on buying toilet paper every month. Too much toilet paper in the bowl can clog it, but water will not. Toilets that use water often have wet floors. And so, they also have a drain on the floor, so that the entire toilet and floor can be washed clean regularly. The hems of pants and skirts are liable to get wet in a wet bathroom, and it takes a lot of careful planning and contortions to ensure that the clothes stay dry.

Edit2 n n One doesn't have to actually touch the poop when using a toilet paper. Toilet paper is easy to carry anywhere you go.n The toilet floors are not wet, making it easy to keep it clean. The underwear of a person who wipes, not washes, smells awfully bad after a trip to the bathroom. For those with pubic hair, the smell is particularly strong.

So they might have had to take some extra effort to get water and use water there. The general populace would be using toilet paper and it would have been easier to ape them than stick to their original habits. They might have had to face social stigma and ridicule for revealing that they use water to wash. It might have been easier to switch. They might not have the conviction and confidence to not only stick to using water, but also to explain the reasoning and benefits of the same to their peers. If the bathroom is a dry bathroom, then using water might make a mess in the bathroom, which is very difficult to clean, especially when there is no drain on the floor like in wet bathrooms that have health faucets. When using water to wash, if any water were to spill on the floor and someone were to slip on it and get injured, there would be additional doctor bills to pay in a foreign land. They may be living in a place where water is scarce. Every drop saved would be water used for drinking. They might have had no option but to use toilet paper when they went to public toilets. n n n The use of toilet paper has been going on for so very long that it is very difficult to convince people of alternative methods. Though toilet paper was invented and extensively used in China, an American called Joseph Gayetty is said to have invented the first commercially available modern toilet paper in the United States in 1857. Considering the fact that people used to use newspapers and corncobs before this, the toilet paper must have seemed like an amazing invention designed to improve hygiene. After this, from the early 20th century onward, different companies tried to commercially manufacture toilet paper. As their manufacturing process and products improved, more people wanted to buy them. People became more dependent upon these toilet papers. This thought process was not only encouraged, it was marketed in such a way that any other form of cleaning process like water was looked down upon. By the 1970s, America could no longer conceive a life without toilet paper. Even now, every family spends a considerable amount of money on toilet paper every month. Currently, the US alone spends over 10 billion a year on toilet paper. One tree produces about 100 pounds 45 kg of toilet paper and about 83 million rolls are produced per day. Global toilet paper production consumes 27,000 trees daily. The average American uses 50 pounds of tissue paper per year, which is nearly 50 greater than that of other Western countries. Millions of trees are harvested in North and South America, leaving fears of ecological footprints. The Toilet Paper Industry provides employment to thousands of people all over the world. There are people who work as loggers for getting the trees, in processing and manufacturing plants, as distributors and retailers for the finished product. It is an industry where profits are sometimes upwards of 500 million for a single company in the US alone. With rising manufacturing costs, toilet paper can get only more expensive as years go by. Why would they even  One of the reasons why some Westerners persist on using toilet paper in spite of knowing about the benefits of water is they have a superiority complex and a big ego. They feel that since 'they' use toilet paper, that is the only right thing to do, and everybody else is wrong. Some of them ridicule and harass those who use water, and call them 'backward', 'thirdworlder' and a whole lot of things which I can't repeat in this forum. Hence, a lot of waterusers switch to toilet paper, or they hide the fact that they use water. It is sad to hear, but it is a true fact. Edit2 n n nEvery country and culture has its own practices and they have their own reasons for following them. On the whole, however, I strongly believe that using nwater is a better option.  nEdit1 After someone commented that trees are not harvested to make toilet paper, I've decided to add this link.  http  www.madehow.com Volume6 ToiletPaper.html It describes the process employed in manufacturing toilet paper.  Edit2 My friends, who read my post, wanted me to add additional details. So adding the ones we discussed.  nSourcesn Why do we use toilet paper instead of water showers, especially in the West? Why do we use Toilet paper instead of water showers? I may regret answering this. I am doing so anyway, because I am bothered by all the posts I've read that imply that Westerners are not very clean because they use toilet paper. I just hope I don't offend any of my Indian friends by writing this, because I love you guys. I just want to set the record straight. Just because we don't use water sprays or have bidets, it doesn't follow that we are unhygienic. There is more than one way to be clean. I can't speak for all Americans, much less all Westerners. I can only tell you what I do, but I am guessing I am fairly typical. Yes, I use toilet paper. I scrub and then check the paper. I scrub some more with a new piece or fold the paper get a clean side and check again. I do this until the toilet paper looks totally clean after wiping. Then, at least nine times out of ten, I get in the shower where I will use not only water, but soap as well. Maybe I'm odd, but I seem to have trained myself to go once a day, right before my shower, so that works very well. Of course, there are always exceptions. In that case, I keep flushable wipes in my bathroom. I use them after I've finished wiping with the toilet paper. I also keep some wipes in my purse, though I avoid public toilets if at all possible and usually only need them if I'm traveling. The wipes aren't just wet with water, they also contain a mild cleanser and emollient. So to me, that seems a bit cleaner than water alone. And I don't have to touch anything nasty. I am very squeamish about the thought of actually touching poop. This way, my hands never get dirty, though I still scrub them with soap and water afterwards. After that, I may still use a washcloth with soap and hot water if it's a while until my shower. I have a stack of inexpensive white washcloths I use for this purpose. I rinse the washcloth with hot water when I'm done. These are washed separately with in hot water with extra detergent and a bit of bleach to keep them sanitary. So I have to say that it bothers me a bit when I read posts that say Westerners are unhygienic because we use toilet paper. Maybe some are, but I am sure I'm not the only one the feels it's important to be clean. Do I think the Indian way is wrong? No, not at all. I realize we all are most comfortable with what we are used to. But I have to admit, I am a bit leery of that method, as my imagination sees poop getting lodged under fingernails and it being difficult to get every speck out. I also would be afraid of where the poop particles that are sprayed out go. I'm assuming most of the poopy water goes into the toilet, but I can't stop thinking that some of it also lands on the floor, the sink, the tub, the walls, etc. I realize that Indian bathrooms have drains in the floor which we don't typically have here, but if I'm the next person in the bathroom, I'm going to be walking through your poop spray. Now I'm sure it's not really as bad as my imagination paints it to be. But that's what in the back of my mind when I think of those bathroom sprayers. I hope I'm wrong about that and it's just my overactive imagination. As an aside, the last time I was in Las Vegas, the hotel room I was in had a bidet built into the toilet. You could choose the water temperature of the spray, and there was also a dryer that blew warm air. I have to admit, I liked the idea. But I didn't feel as clean with just plain water. And even with the dryer, I still felt the need to use toilet paper to dry completely and to make sure everything was scrubbed. So, while I wanted to like it and I would use it if it's available, I still am most comfortable with what I'm used to. And I'm sure those who prefer the water spray are most comfortable with that. We all have our comfort zone, I suppose. I seem to have wandered off point a bit, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that just because we use toilet paper, it doesn't necessarily follow that we only use toilet paper, and it certainly doesn't mean that we are less than clean. I think we can all agree that hygiene is important and nobody wants to be unclean back there. How do Westerners feel clean simply from wiping their feces with dry toilet paper? If you use wet wipes regularly, please stop right away They may say flushable, but they arent really. I guess they are, in that they can be flushed, but many things  Toilet paper is designed for sewer systems. It disintegrates quickly once flushed, freely flowing through pipes. Wet wipes do not. In fact, taxpayers spend thousands upon thousands every year in extracting these flushable wipes when they become fatbergs. A fatberg is when a non biodegradable item most often wet wipes congeals together with cooking fat in the sewer system. They are extremely costly, gross, and time consuming to extract from the sewer. Thats if they get to the sewer at all. More likely is that they will become lodged in your pipes. This, unfortunately happened to me, before I knew the perils of flushable wipes. The toilet stopped working and I had no idea why. Imagine my embarrassment when the plumber told me it was because of all the wet wipes Id flushed. He had to remove my poop covered wet wipes from my pipes. I still cant get the image of him looking at them out of my head. I was naive, and figured if they said flushable, they should be able to be flushed without a single problem. I dont know how they are legally still able to market these as flushable. They are not biodegradable and are a terrible product. If you MUST use them, please throw them in the trash at least, just as you would baby wipes BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EXACT SAME THING. Of course make sure they are contained in some sort of sealed bag that has no danger or opening as human waste is full of pathogens. But the much more environmentally friendly thing to do is just go back to plain old toilet paper. Cleaning babies bottoms is difficult and it makes sense that we use wipes for that, but please dont add to the problem If everyone started using these things, forget about flushing them, if they disposed of them as they should, in the garbage, wed likely see a lot of sicknesses return to our society that had been eradicated by the invention of plumbing. There is just no moral way to dispose of them, and thus no way to justify using them. Why is toilet paper still used when there are alternatives such as wet wipes? Why do we need toilet paper? What is supposed to be done with the toilet paper after using it? How many wipes do you use to clean your butt? How do armless people wipe themselves on the toilet? Today we use wipes and toilet paper. What did they use to wipe the ass back in the old days? Question I used to use toilet paper on its own. Then wetwipes. Now I use something else. Answer  Then I soon found out that some wetwipes were not recyclable, flushable or environmentally unfriendly. So, instead of wetwipes, I have a bottle of antibacterial handwipe by the toilet which is only used for toilet purposes. NOTE I have been doing this for years without any anal problems. at my own risk  ,  I squirt a small amount onto the toilet paper as soon as Im done wiping with the dry toilet paper to ensure I am clean and hygienic. Its the only way. Everything easily flush able. Analogy. If anyone accidentally touched some poop, would they be happy with using only dry paper to clean it off? No They would want and need something wet and soapy to clean their hands thoroughly Please wash your hands before leaving this page D Do you use toilet paper, wet wipes or something else? Better? Ah, would that be for your bum or for the entire planet? They can be really nice for your bum and clean better than paper does but for the planet they are a freaking disaster. Wipes are a gigantic problem for plumbing, the pipes, sewers, septic tanks, wastewater treatment plants, wildlife and the oceans. Ones taxes go up to pay for all those problems, or one pays the plumber to clear the clogs, I hope you realize that? If you run a septic system youd be paying the honeywagon to show up more often and clean out the mess they make of the septic tank and you can expect the honeywagon guy to be pissed about the wipes because they make his job even more of a hassle. Most wipes and this includes wipes and cleaning wipes, are made of synethetic material that does not break down. Environmentally, theyre a terrible idea, all of them. Theyre also much more expensive to use than toilet paper. But if you dont mind paying for them and dont mind carrying them with you everywhere so you have them to use and if you are willing to dispose of them in the trash and it doesnt bother you that they are going to end up in the landfill practically forever, then by all means, be my guest and wet wipe your bum. Is it better to use wet wipes for wiping your bum than toilet paper? Wet,  Wet,  Costs, availability, convenience, locations, business style and economics, and market draw  all these factor into its very rare or its common standard use. At an exclusive and private country club or resort, I could see the marketing attractiveness to offer both. At the local McDonalds by I80 or I5, no TP is all you get for that price point if it has been timely serviced and refilled at all.

Without getting graphic, bowel movements and mucosal skin types can highly vary from person to person, diet to diet, day to day, healthy to  Why do we use dry toilet paper instead of wet wipes?

218,How do you clean house with No help I just moved in its years behind in everything I dont mind cleaning but ppl trash what I do clean and do not clean after themselves Im so overwhelmed but moving is not an option,"I am guessing you live in a group house or something similar where all of you should be cooperating to make it a pleasant place to live. One option is to isolate yourself as much as possible, taking care only of your needs, and spending most of your time in your apartment, but what a shame. Another possibility is to discuss it with them but that also seems unlikely to work. If even one of them catches on things might improve a bit. You might look for an opportunity like that.

220,How do I get a pen out of a shirt,"Ive had good luck with a Grandmas Secret Stain Remover  a fabric purse had a pen point poke through and it wrote a mark on the side of my pants about the size of a USA paper dollar billHUGE stain. Washing did nothing, so I treated it with several drops of the Grandmas secret  so that all of the ink mark had the stain remover on it, and washed it again. I think I had to do this one more time to get every last bit of the ink mark out  but I wore those pants for several more years. Do not put the washed pants into the dryer until every last bit of ink has been removed  let the garment air dry to see if there is any remaining stain before treating it after the first time. The heat from the dryer will set the stain to the point that only scissors can remove it from the fabric  and a hole in the fabric is not a good thing. How do you get pen out of clothing? How do I get dried ink out of clothes? How do you properly remove sticker residue from clothing? How do I remove pen ink from trousers? Is there any kind of pen that could never leak ink onto my clothes or other belongings? What's the best way to get mineral spirit paint thinner stains out of clothing? From personal experience permanent Whether hair permanents' that thankfully grow out and you can cut off the remaining straw that used to be your home perm, or relationships that turn out to not be so permanent dye is only so permanent. Case in point I bought a long tshirt around 2005. Black with a gorgeous butterfly screened on it. One that the buttom angled from one hip to longer on the other side. I felt so hot in it that when my Christian sister AND Christian sister inlaw said you've gotta buy that top I did. It's now pajamas when I travel with my sister. I digress. So? I'm waiting to get picked up by friends and go off to meet more friends. The driving friends called and said were running a half hour late What do I do while I wait? I spray down the counters with a bleach cleaner. Let it sit for 5 minutes and came back to wipe the counter down. Sprayed a little too much cleaner on and the cleaner was dripping off the front of the counter. Onto my fave top. Left it to soak in water, wore another top and off I went. Washed and dried the top. Got out a black sharpie pen and filled in the bleached out spots. Top faded so I picked up a dark grey pen. Sharpie faded  better matching Sharpie or stronger than a Sharpie pen purchased. And so on. Sharpies all fade. They are an ink and fade under light, their molecules crumble from the tumbling of washing. Sunlight seems to speed up the fading. Maybe think about a more durable option like screen print the design. Or Batik it with a dye from a specialty shop. Or consider it temporary. Cover the top or whatever in Sharpies Wear it, enjoy it and share it. I knit, but only to give as gifts. Make a business based on the temporary aspect of the design, and, of course its environmentally conscious elements. Tie dye keeps coming back around every generation. Ooh new retirement idea. You're welcome to use that idea btw. I digress. You'll figure out the best pens for permanence. And how the pen moves on the fabric. And what the next idea you're going to have fun with is Colours fade at different rates. Factors To Consider what the Base fabric is made of  natural fibres hold dye and ink best but wear sooner than a cotton poly shirt  but the poly fibres dont hold sharpie colour ink well. the depth of the fabric being penned or screened worn outdoors or indoors? Everyday or occasionally? permanence to impermanence Is a sliding scale. My personal feeling is that function goes before form. What is its use? Then imbue the design with your imagination flourishes or repeat elements as a signature. Rock out with those Sharpies Are Sharpie pens good for permanently marking clothing?

221,Is there a good reusable option for cleaning mirrors,"I use a microfibre cloth and water, actually two microfibre cloths one damp and one dry. The microfibre cloths I have, have a smooth and a rough side. If needed the rough side can be used to scrub spots that are a bit harder to clean. Once I started using microfibre cloths for cleaning I realise they can perform so many jobs just using a little water that there is no need to bring in any detergent or spray cleaners unless required for disinfecting. My husband does a great job cleaning mirrors or windows with damp newspaper which is reusing something that is put in the compost after the job. Is there a good reusable option for cleaning mirrors? Are all recycled products cleaned before it is used again? Which type of curved mirror uses its inside as the reflecting surface? Which material is used to make mirrors? What are some general cleaning equipments? What causes a mirror to tarnish? Alcohol based glass cleaner and a clean dry towel rag is what we use professionally.

224,How often should I clean my MTB chain,"You dont need to sterilize it, just get the gravel dust and water off of it. There isnt any regular chaincleaning interval you have to adhere to, since the chain is going to get that indelible black grime on it no matter what you do. I clean my MTB chain every time I ride on gravel and every time I ride in the rain. I dont use one of those contraptions with rotating brushes and a solvent reservoir. I use a stiff nylon brush and White Lightning chain lube. If you have a workstand, put the bike in that, or lean it against a wall in such a way that you can freely rotate the cranks backwards. Shift the front derailleur if you have one to the middle ring, the rear derailleur to the centermost cog, and dribble the chain lube onto the chain at the center of the cog. Run the chain for 3 or 4 cycles while youre doing this, then continue to run the chain while you brush off the dirt. Finish up with a rag to get rid of the excess lube. Its more important to dig the debris and grime out of your rear cogs. Park makes a tool for this, but you can use any thin tool, like a putty knife, to get in between the cogs to loosen up the crud that gets stuck in there. I finish the job with pipe cleaners and WD40. Once again, you are not looking for a mirror finish, just get the stubborn stuff out. The only time I clean a chain is when I replace it. Brand new chains come packed in a heavy oil that isnt suitable for the road or trail. I use mineral spirits to wash it out of the chain, then hang it up to dry. I give it a good drink of chain lube after I install it, and Im good to go. How often should I clean my MTB chain?

Dishes not washed for more than 3 weeks and the odor is awful, are they still  Lisa, in our household the dishes are washed and dried in the automatic dishwasher. Now you might want to rephrase your question to ask, who loads and unloads the dishwasher? When we had kids still at home, they were assigned the task of loading the dishwasher and when the dishwasher had completed its task, they would put the dishes away. Then when they grew up and left home, my wife usually took over that task. However, when I retired from my profession, I took over the duties of loading the dishwasher and unloading it and putting the dishes away, while my wife prepared our meals. But now that were getting well into our seventies, Ive taken over much of the food preparation and dish washing tasks. When I say, Ive taken over the food preparation, that means I place the orders with the local restaurants and go fetch our meals when theyre ready to be picked up. I also do all of the dish washing and dish storage tasks. My wife deserves a break. Oh, by the way, I wash and dry my clothing and put it away and my wife does the same thing for her clothing. As for bedding and towels and wash clothes, I take care of washing and drying and putting them away. Its worked out well for us and we both fell happy with that. Oh, one other thing. What about the yard upkeep? We have two yard services, one does the front yard and another does the back. Why two companies? Because Im real picky about how the back yard is maintained, so I hired a young man to come in and close cuts the back lawn using an electric push mower. The service that does the front lawn comes in with one of those big riding monster mowers and thats good enough for the front. So what happens when one or the other of us passes away? If I go first, my wife will move to a retirement home where everything is take care of. If she goes first, Im going to sell the house and move into a downtown loft where I can spend my days writing inane articles like this one. No retirement home for me. I like being alone and on my own. How are the dishes washed in your household, and who performs that task? If a sponge is smelly, do I throw it away or clean it by cleaning other dishes with dish soap?"

250,What is the best washer setting you can use to prevent clothes from shrinking,"The setting that makes the most difference regarding shrinking isnt on the washer but is on the dryer. The hotter and longer you run the dryer, the more shrinkage youre likely to get. And fading of colors too. If you dont want your clothes to shrink or fade then skip the dryer entirely. And as someone else wrote, lay the items flat to air dry. But I dont have enough real estate in my house to do that, so I use a foldable drying rack. You can put items like sweaters over the top, and theyll be drying is someone of a flat position.  ,  As to wash temperature, Ive worried that hot or even warm water could cause shrinkage. But in my experience, it hasnt. Hot water can cause colors to fade or bleed though, and I imagine warm water can toothough not as much. But to be on the safe side, wash your clothes in cold water when possible some stained or extra dirty items may need warm or hot water. And I suggest using hot water only for white items. What is the best washer setting you can use to prevent clothes from shrinking? Does the washer ruin your clothes? Do newer model washers and dryers get clothes done more efficiently and faster? How many clothes can one put into a 6kg front load washing machine? Is it possible for a washer and dryer to be combined into one machine? How much clothes will go in a 4.5 kg washer? Reduce the frequency of laundry day Washing and drying your clothes often will damage the colour and fit. The best way to combat this is to keep your clothes clean so you don't need to wash them as often. While this can seem like an easy solution, most women avoid wearing undershirts to protect from sweat stains and everyday wear. The right undershirt can help keep your clothes clean so you can confidently wear it several times before it becomes necessary to wash them. This is one of the best ways to extend the life of your clothes and avoid shrinking.  ,  Read and Follow the Labels All clothing pieces come with a list of do's don'ts of laundry, most labels will specify the best way to wash your clothes to avoid damages. Whether this means dry cleaning, washing at home, specific water temperatures or laundry cycle, it's important to pay attention. If the label indicates it has been prewashed it will not shrink as much over the course of its life. Wash with Cold Water While this does not guarantee that you will avoid shrinking your clothes, cold water is not as damaging on the fabrics as warm and hot water are. Hot water can cause your clothing to relax and release tension which will result in the fabric becoming misshapen. Most modern washing machines and detergents can remove dirt as easily in the cold water setting, but to ensure they are properly cleaned add a bit more detergent in your wash next time. Air Dry Your Clothing If you really want to do your best to prevent shrinkage, it is best to air dry your clothes. This is the safest method. If you have any loosely woven or knitted clothing it is best to roll it out in a towel and leave it on a flat surface to dry. Avoid hanging clothes on hangers to dry as the added weight of the water will result in stretching of the fabric, instead drape them over a rack or hanger. If you prefer not to air dry your clothing but still want to ensure it does not shrink then select a lower heat setting on the machine and take the clothes out while still a bit damp. This will prevent the clothes from over drying which is harmful to the fabrics. What are good ways to prevent leather clothing from shrinking? I'd have to say that the COLD WATER setting and NEVER use Warm and DEFINITELY NOT EVER use the setting for HOT WATER. BUT if really want to guarantee that you won't Shrink your clothes AS WELL AS keeping them looking as New as the day you bought them, I'd definitely suggest that you take those clothes to a company that offers regular  dry cleaning and tell them that you'd like to have them Dry Cleaned. It may cost a little more than just having them laundered because my wife's been having her nice blue jeans Dry Cleaned for the last three years and I swear that they're just as New Looking as the day she bought them, which definitely surprised me. Because I've only washed mine in the washing machine which I bought at the same time and mine definitely look like they're 10 years older, if not longer, than hers, but don't take my word for it, instead buy Two pairs and clean one regularly and Dry Clean the other one AND SEE FOR YOURSELF the difference it'll make for your clothes and you'll be just as surprised as I've been. Sincerely, Mr. B 12121 Richelle  Cross dressing What is the best washer setting you can use to prevent clothes from shrinking? Does fabric shrink in the washer or the dryer? Most organic fibers relax and can even expand when wet. However, drying, expecially with heat, can cause the fibers even synthetic, though less so to shrink past their original dimension. Also, the washing drying process can cause loss of loft in a fiber. This, in turn, can allow the fibers to compact more closely together, which also results in shrinking too. Again, much more with organic than synthetic fibers. Does fabric shrink in the washer or the dryer? How many clothes can one put into a 6kg front load washing machine? When doing laundry, why do we need to separate light clothes and dark clothes in different washes? Is it bad to let clothes sit in the dryer? What are clothes that need no washing?

I hanger dry most shirts and more delicate items, drying in a dryer is inviting shrinkage. Most washers have a delicate setting for washing those fancy and lacy little things. Richelle  Cross dressing What is the best washer setting you can use to prevent clothes from shrinking? Whichever setting uses cold water for the wash cycle. Usually that would be delicates. But If your washing machine allows you to switch from hot to cold on All cycles then of course you could use any cycle that fits the type of materials you're washing  just switch to cold water. Also, if you're concerned about shrinking don't use a dryer. Hang the clothing flat to dry. What is the best washer setting you can use to prevent clothes from shrinking?

255,Does restoring plan defaults fixes laptop fan noise as another option if taking it apart or or cleaning the insides of the laptop doesnt work,"Noisy laptop fan comes from when not under heavy loads of course Dirt and lints are stuck into the heatsink blocking airflow. Failing fan vibrates and makes more noise than usual. Fan management settings are set to constant full speed for maximum laptop performance. CPU power management features have been disabled in BIOS UEFI. And my favorite the thermal paste has become dried out and cracked and its no longer capable of moving CPU heat to the heatsink. Does restoring plan defaults fixes laptop fan noise as another option if taking it apart or or cleaning the insides of the laptop doesn't work? How do I fix the CPU fan on my Lenovo laptop? Why isn't my Lenovo laptop powering on? Will keeping a laptop fan manually on full blast wear out the fan's components? My laptop fans 2 aren't running at the same speed. Is this how it should work typically? My laptop flashed the warning 'Cooling fan isn't working properly. There might be alterations in the working of your computer'. Is this serious? What should I do? It depends on the noise. If the fan is just running at high speed it is likely that the intakes are blocked with dust. You can just blow back through where the hot air comes out or use the vacuum cleaner on the intake end you can tell where it is by blocking it off with your hand and listening for load on the fan. Sometimes the fan sucks in something that might partially jam it, which might cause a grinding sound. The cure is either blowing or sucking it out as above. A compressor can be used for this if other methods fail. Sometimes the fan bearings get noisy in older computers. This is the most likely grinding noise caused by the oil in the bearings drying out over a period of time. In this case blowing it out might help a bit but really you have to lubricate or replace the fan which is a moderately difficult job depending on the availability of the part. It is not easy to lubricate small fans but I have removed the fan unplug its cable, peeled off the round label which covers the bearing and used silicon spray lube successfully. You could use 3in1 oil. Spray will tend to get all over the little circuit board inside so leave it to evaporate a bit before reinstalling and testing. Access to the fan is usually by removing the back of the laptop, which is not always straightforward. You can look up your model of laptop and check YouTube to see if disassembly is easy enough to tackle. The fan may be in one piece with the copper heatsink which will mean replacing the heatsink paste. Messing with mainboards can be dangerous and it is best to keep fingers off the components to prevent static or other damage. I once ruined the mainboard on my PC just trying to flick heatsink clips off with a screwdriver when it slipped and cut through a row of tracks on the board. How do I fix my laptop fan if it's making a grinding noise? Does restoring plan defaults fixes laptop fan noise as another option if taking it apart or or cleaning the insides of the laptop doesn't work?"

What is chloric acid used for? Are hydrochloric acid and lye used to clean, or extract methamphetamine? How can I safely generate hypochlorous acid disinfectant at home? What is the use of sulphonic acid in making liquid soap? What happens when you mix a product containing sodium lauryl sulfate with another that has hydrochloric acid? I wanted to provide information and background with my question. It seems that Quora only allows me to enter a onesentence question, so I will provide the additional information in this answer. Im not trying to answer my own question. I bought a home generator for making hypochlorous acid by electrolysis of a water and salt solution. I would like to figure out guidelines for safe and effective use of my generator. I have found multiple resources saying that hypochlorous acid solution is not harmful to people or animals and yet very effective as a disinfectant. A lab made mice drink it instead of water for weeks with no observed ill effects the FDA allows it to be used as a norinse disinfectant in food prep areas and people routinely put it into  Currently my area is concerned about COVID19 and the store shelves have been stripped of toilet paper and disinfectants. I wish to be able to make disinfectant when I need it. Hypochlorous acid breaks down quickly, but I believe it will still be effective for up to a week, and it's just a few pennies worth of ingredients and electricity to make another batch. The device came with a terse instruction booklet, which is written in reasonable English but nonetheless leaves me with questions. The booklet says to mix 2 litres of water with 12 grams of pure salt I'm planning to use kosher salt. Then activate the electrolysis and let it run. Then dilute the solution 41 before using. Here is a table of suggested times for electrolysis  5 minutes to make 200 PPM  15 minutes to make 500 PPM  30 minutes to make 1000 PPM The device has a builtin timer that can be set for these three time intervals, and then stops the electrolysis automatically. When I bought the device, the Internet retailer web site showed me that often people buy test strips with it. I thought that was a good idea so I bought both pH test strips and chlorine PPM test strips. The booklet does not discuss this, but I have read that it is a good idea to add vinegar to the water as well as salt, because there are multiple possible reactions when you electrolyze the saline solution, and you want the hypochlorous acid solution and not sodium hypochlorite. And in fact there is one brand of home hypochlorous acid generator that sells small plastic capsules containing a premeasured mixture of vinegar and salt. Their web site claims the FDA requires them to sell the premeasured capsules to make sure the end user gets the recipe correct. I searched the Internet for a set of guidelines for the home user, and found a discussion on another site that urged adding a base rather than an acid to the salt solution before electrolysis. I've only seen that one place the suggestion to add vinegar seems to be the common advice. The booklet says the reaction is NaCl  H20  NaClO  H2 While the booklet doesnt discuss the hardware, the Gosoit web site makes these claims about the device with latest Platinum coated Titanium SPE electrolysis Plates and the long lifetime Proton Membrane PEM made by DuPont in the USA. I've seen videos of devices like this in operation and bubbles appear in the water presumably that's the H2. Is there any worry it might generate chlorine gas or anything else bad? I'm planning to use this in a wellventilated area. We have a large supply of powdered citric acid, so if adding acid is a good idea I would like to work out a recipe that uses citric acid and salt instead of vinegar and salt. According to a video I found, ideally the salt solution should have a pH of  And I would like to know what I should expect to see on the test strips if the reaction was the desired one. What should I expect the final pH to be? Presumably the PPM test just shows PPM directly and should match what I'm trying to make by setting the timer. I'd like a recipe to make 1 litre at a time. And ideally I'd like to work out a recipe I can use without diluting it... one litre of spray disinfectant easily should last me a week I don't need to make 4 litres at a time. References The generator I bought     Article suggesting that hypochlorous acid is a safe and effective disinfectant   The Safety Data Sheet for the Force of Nature brand generator which uses premeasured capsules of vinegar and salt   EPA listing of disinfectants known to be effective against SARSCoV2, which includes hypochlorous acid   FDA allows it for food prep with no rinse   The generator that sells premeasured capsules of vinegar and salt   Discussion on another site suggesting that one should add a base, not an acid, to the water   One of the many videos I found about making hypochlorous acid   A video showing a recipe to use instead of the premixed plastic capsules   How can I safely generate hypochlorous acid disinfectant at home? Chlorinebased bleach is a basic solution containing chlorateI ion  It is effective due to the chlorateI ion When dissolved in water it slowly decomposes, releasing sodium ions, chloride ions, and hydroxyl radicalsn Sodium hypochlorite reacts with most nitrogen compounds to form volatile chloramines, dichloramines, and nitrogen trichloriden The chlorateI ion thus help to achieve its deodouring and decontaiminating purposes. These chlorateI ions need to kept in a basic solution to prevent it from undergoing reduction with cholride ions form cholrine. 2H  ClO  Cl  Cl2  H2O You may argue with the absence of  NaClO  H2O  Na  Cl  2 HO Hence bleach is a basic solution to minimise the production of cholrine during storage, thus prolonging its shelf life.

Ok other direction, if you want to neutralize the acid to enhance oxidizing ability. In gentle oxidations relative term one can convert a solution of hypochlorite ions to a solution of hypochlorous acid by addition of enough acetic acid vinegar  to neutralize the hypochlorite ion  pH of about 4. The hypochlorous acid is a stonger oxidizing agent than hypochlorite ion and is commonly used as a green oxidant to convert secondary alcohols to ketones. From a lab procedure in Organic chemistry  Sodium hypochlorite and glacial acetic acid combine to make hypochlorous acid. Hypochlorous acid HOCl oxidizes cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone. At the end of the reaction, any excess hypochlorous acid must be neutralized with small amounts of sodium bisulfite which would also neutralize the starting bleach. CAUTION THIS SECOND REACTION WITH NaHSO3 GIVES OFF SO2 GAS SO DO IT IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. BONUS sodium bisulfite is a weak acid.  What acid is best to neutralize chlorine bleach?

267,How often is underwear found when cleaning a hotel room I just got a job cleaning rooms at a hotel In my first 2 days I have found 3 different pairs How commonly do people forget their underwear And how,"How often is underwear found when cleaning a hotel room? Frequently. A housekeeper may find two or three pairs in a day. They get tangled up in the sheets during intimate times or kicked off in the middle of the night they fall behind beds or get forgotten in bathrooms. While we do hold onto items left behind by guests for a determinate amount of time, underwear has fallen into a category that gets disposed of as they clean the rooms  unless, of course, its a new Victorias Secret bra with tags still on it  that will go into our lost and found, and if unclaimed, gets first dibs by the house keeper that found it. Interesting story involving pantiesnI had a friend that was going to college, and had quite the crush on the city bus driver in town. She never could bring up the courage to talk to him One day, she smiles at him, he smiles at her and asks her, Maam? Can I ask you something? Her mind starts racing. Is he about to ask me out? goes through her mind. With her slyest smile, she says Yes? He points down to her feet and asks if she had forgotten something. She looks down, and through her pants leg, she is trailing a pair of panties that she had forgotten in her jeans when she removed them. Nothing frilly, nothing nice  a great big pair of grandmastyle ones. I and other mutual friends ended up driving her to classes for the remainder of the semester, she was so mortified. How often is underwear found when cleaning a hotel room? I just got a job cleaning rooms at a hotel. In my first 2 days I have found 3 different pairs.. How commonly do people forget their underwear? And how? Hotel housekeeping What is the most disgusting thing youve ever encountered while cleaning a room? Can hotels ever have enough cleaning standards post covid 19? What do you do if you find bed bugs in the hotel room? Have you ever had a room service delivered and answered the door in your underwear? I stay at hotels a lot. Would housekeeping rather clean my room everyday or very few days? Do they get more hours or paid by the room? Its never messy but a fresh bed is always nice. This is by far one of the worst days I ever had while cleaning rooms on my former job. We had several rooms rented on a weekly basis to groups of men from out of the area working on local construction type jobs. Sometimes there would be 4 or 5 guys per room. That alone should let you in on what kind of messes I would encounter. Well anyway one morning one of these groups had checked out and I was making my first round of retrieving all the dirty linens. When I got to this particular room and went to open the door I was immediately aware that something was not right. The door had been set up to be a booby trap of sorts. Heres where it gets disgusting. The occupants had used the chair that was provided to use at the desk table and wedged it into the corner behind the door . They apparently had exited the room through the window as it was on the ground floor. So here I am trying to get into the room and this chair is in the corner behind the door presenting me with difficulties in opening it after a certain point. I, getting easily aggravated, started pushing the the door back and forth with much aggression just trying to get into the dang room. I get it open enough that I squeeze into the partially open door and reach around and grab this chair to move it out of the way. Thats when the booby trap went off. They had tied one end of a bag to the chair and the other end to the doorknob. The bag was full of vomit and when I was squeezing through the door the bag broke and my legs and shoes were covered with this disgusting vomit reeking of beer and hot wings. I was not having a good day already and that was all it took to set me off. I stormed to the office were the owner was. He knew my temper and saw me coming through the supply area like I was on fire. I walked up to him and stopped, letting him take in this vomit all over me and informed him VOMIT and that I was done for the day and going home. I told him he needed to check out the room I had just came from and then went to find the garden hose to hose myself off before getting into my car. The next day when I went to work I discovered that the room was left in the same condition as when I had left the day before and I wasnt getting out of cleaning it up. Needless to say I was not happy about that and spent the entire day in one of the worst moods I could ever have to be in. My boss never mentioned the incident from the day before not one time to me and walked on egg shells for several days around me. He knew I hated cleaning up after rooms full of work crews but knew I always did a good job and never had complaints. Except from me of course. Im sure the guys that did this were having a good laugh planning and setting this up. Whether it was intentionally for me or not Ill never know but its a good thing they had left and never returned because if they had returned theres no telling what I might have done. I sure wasnt laughing about it though it thats for sure. For hotel staff, what's the worst thing youve found when cleaning a room?

I've been to houses where people were clearly engaging in adult activities Let's just say I found a lot of scenarios with customers at their home . Have you ever seen someone answer the door in their underwear? Yes, I have. True story. It was a frightening event, and one of my luckiest happenings ever. Was staying in a hotel with several friends and we each had our own rooms on the first floor just down the hallway from the front desk. Think it was a Holiday Inn Express or something similar. After a night out with dinner and drinks, we returned to our rooms to sleep, as we had an early morning travel schedule. Have to head to the airport at 4am. Got my bag packed up, called the front desk to get a 330am wakeup call, and jumped in bed. I fell quickly asleep, and the next thing I know is that Im standing outside my door, and the door is closing. Not knowing whats going on, I tried to stop the door from closing with no luck. Im in a complete fog. No idea whats going on or how I got there. Go to grab my room key that I always keep in my pocket only to realize I have no pockets, and am completely naked And locked out of my room. I hear people nearby in the lobby, and am absolutely panicked now. Looks like I had 1 too many drinks, and was sleep walking. With no idea of what to do, I head down the hallway looking for a room or something to duck into so Im naught caught out in the open. Maybe I can find a housekeeping cart or room and grab a towel, so I can go to the front desk and get a key to my room. I find an inset area, and its a laundry room Woohoo I see the key pass box on it, and think oh crap, I dont have a key to even get in there Holy cow, the door isnt closed all the way, so isnt locked Luck 1. I go in, and the room is completely empty except a washer and dryer, and small folding table and chair. Nothing to help me at all I open the washing machine, its empty. Open the dryer, its empty. Damn it Now Im a little freaked out. I scan the room again, and nothing. Search washer again, nothing. Search dryer again. wait, what is that? A pair of boxers is stuck on the little rail inside the dryer about half way up the side. Holy crap Their owner also didnt see them when unloading the dryer. Luck 2. Damn, I can get them on, but they are way to snug. Oh well, I guess Ill just walk to the lobby and get a key. I will surely get a big laugh from the front desk lady, but oh well. Open the door and I can hear even more people in the lobby. peek my head around the corner, and there are now fine dressed people crossing by the end of my hall. Oh hell, a wedding party apparently is returning. Shit. Now what? Theres no way in hell Im walking to the lobby now. Ok, maybe I can wait it out and work up the courage to go to the lobby once people return to their rooms. I look absolutely ridiculous. but I have no other option. I wait at least 15 minutes in there, with the light shut off so people cant see me through the glass, and people are still returning to the hotel from this damn wedding reception. At this point, Im kind of setting   leaning on a little white table in the room. just waiting this crap out. My foot kind of drifts over by the washing machine and I feel something on the floor. Thought it was a bug, so I pull my foot back quickly  and stub my little toe on the leg of the table Oh fuck Hurts like hell, is bleeding, and at this point Im pretty sure its broken I feel it bleeding pretty bad, so I flip the light on to take a quick look at what Im dealing with. Yep  toenail ripped off, toe is crooked, and its bleeding like a mofo. I go to look at the table and chair legs to figure out how that even happened, and something catches my eye under the washing machine. The bug I originally felt, wasnt a bug after all. It was a room key that was under the machine, and moved when I put my foot on it. Holy crap  this is great news. Why, you ask? Sure, I know it wont work for my room  but I can pick most common styles of hotel doors with a credit card or room key. An old college dorm trick I learned years ago. Luck 3. Its worth a shot, right. I make a break for my room, and as Im trying to get the key to fit inside the door jam, I hear the lobby getting louder and louder. Oh shit. Just as people were rounding the corner coming down my hallway, the door pops open and I make it, in the nick of time. Thank God. I avoided an embarrassing conversation I didnt want to have. I take a big breath, jump in bed  relieved. Had to be 1 minute later my room phone rings  and its one of my buddies asking where the hell I am that were late Oh shit Im thinking its maybe 2 in the morning. While I was trapped in the laundry room, apparently I was getting the automated wakeup call, and I had no idea is was now about 410am  Luck 4 was making it into my room on time. Grabbed some clothes, my bag and headed off to catch my flight. Probably the most bizarre experience Ive ever had. Scaring, and SO LUCKY at the same time Have you ever gone into a hotel hallway in your underwear? What do hotel room cleaners do with stuff you forget and leave behind? Have you ever gone into a hotel hallway in your underwear? Have you ever had a room service delivered and answered the door in your underwear? What do you think when a hotel guest leaves the do not disturb sign on their door for the duration of their stay so you can't clean the room? How often do housekeeping clean a hotel room when you are staying multiple days? Have you ever been locked out of your hotel room in your underwear? Well, not exactly but close. I just didnt have any underwear on. My husband and I were in Syracuse NY at a cute little hotel. It was a 3 story building and we were on the 3rd floor. The ice machine was in the stairwell, between the 2nd and 3rd floors. I had been taking Lyrica for a while and one of the more rare side effect is sleepwalking. I learned this the hard way. Since I was asleep for most of this story, all I can tell you is what I remember. When hubby and I went to bed, I was wearing a short, short nightie and nothing else. Next thing I knew, I woke up in the elevator lobby. The only reason I woke up is because two people were getting ice loudly and the stairwell was just beside the elevator lobby. I scampered back to my hotel room, hoping they would go down to the second floor, rather than up to the third. Thankfully, they did Now the next problem. Hubby is a sound sleeper. As Im running back to my room, all I can think is how hotel door rooms automatically lock when you leave. And Im was a nightie that barely covered my butt With no panties And no ID How am I possibly going to go down to the lobby and get a new key? I reached my room, and I couldnt believe it The door didnt close all the way I went it, snuggled up to my husband, and fell back to sleep. I didnt remember any of it til breakfast the next morning. Sometimes, our guardian angels are there when we need the most Have you ever been locked out of your hotel room in your underwear? As a past hotel housekeeping employee back in the '90's, I can say that we were to clean the room once every day, despite how long the room was occupied for. We were to clean the entire bathroom, changing all used towels and face cloths, wipe up and dust the furniture, remove all garbage and dirty dishes  if there was room service. We were to change the sheets daily, unless instructed by the guest that the bed just needed to be made, not changed. Lastly, we were to vacuum the carpet  sweep and mop floors. A lot of hotels today are leaning toward being green. This means trying to reduce, reuse, recycle. That being said, a lot of hotels will ask that you reuse bed linens and towels if possible, but will still change them if you request. Some places have signs for you to place on your bed stating whether or not to change the sheets. It's also usually a given that if towels are placed on the bathroom floor or in the tub, it means that they are dirty and need replacing. How often do housekeeping clean a hotel room when you are staying multiple days? well, last year, i left a new swimsuit in a hotel room because i had tried it on just before we went down to the pool, and it didnt fit right, and we were about to fly long haul so i just thought to leave it in the room, and maybe it would fit the maid better. i also left our little kettle in a hotel room as a tip for the maids. we had bought it because the hotel wanted 8 dollars for one single cup of coffee brought to the room. as if. so we bought the kettle from a nearby shop for 20 dollars, and had all the coffee we wanted that entire week. but i didnt want to take it back to the UK. so again, i just left it for the maids. ive also accidentally left a pair of branded black trainers in the room because i didnt see them as we packed our bags, as the room was a bit dark. that one hurt cos i loved those trainers and i had just bought them. with underwear, i guess its easy to leave it in the bed if youve had a night of sex. who knows. but maids find a lot of things in rooms. i would imagine its a perk of the job. and they dont get many, do they. How often do people leave clothes in hotel rooms? I have found underwear in rooms on multiple occasions. It makes me wonder how often do workers find underwear if I have multiple times? How do people forget their underwear? Well I can say I was never caught off guard me I have always and still do wear briefs when I was young and went to gym class I stripped down to my tighty whites and other kids seen me but they never said anything and the one's that did I would look at them and tell them are you queers because what are paying so much attention on what underwear I'm wearing and really I told them what if I whipped there ass in my briefs but like I say should watch what you say to somebody that had a violent in him I'm not no bad ass but I was not going to have some dumb ass talking about my briefs I wore and as a man who secure with him self I have gone out in my briefs and long tshirt nobody said nothing for awhile until some people must been able to see that I had on briefs under the t shirt but the tshirt was long enough so you could of not known if I had shorts on or they were wondering what I had on but it did not bother me but I told them I was wearing underwear but I would ever think that I was caught because if someone saw you in your underwear I think it's better than not having anything on but I have heard from friends they got caught in there underwear in time they would rather not been in but me my grilfriend and my close friends see me when I'm wearing a tshirt and briefs there not bothered by because I been that way for a long time and I don't people should be embarrassed Bering seen in there underwear Have you ever been caught somewhere either in public or private in just your underwear or less?

Do KN air filters make much of a difference in performance? Why do we need A C filters inside the home and not when we are outside? Filters inside are to protect your indoor air handling unit, not you. You need A C filters in your indoor air handling unit to remove as much particulate from the air inside your home as possible. Without the filter, the dust will accumulate on the cooling coil and ultimately stop it up. Without the filter, when it becomes stopped up, you would have to clean the cooling coil, a maintenance task which is beyond the ordinary homeowners capability. Home owners can easily and cheaply replace the filters themselves. The reason we dont need filters when we go outside, most places, is because our respiration system is fully capable of renewing itself as dust accumulates, as long as you live in ordinary outside air conditions.

276,How do you get bluing out of white clothes,"Depends on the type of bluing. Touchup bluing the only kind you're likely to encounter outside a gunsmith's workshop is a chemical that reacts with iron to produce a blue black finish. It isn't blue in itself, but it may stain clothes or damage the fabric some contain acids. Layout bluing is a nitrocellulose lacquer, soluble in alcohol. You will be able to get the nitrocellulose binder out of the clothes without a problem, but the dye might have permanently stained the fabric. Laundry bluing is used because manytimes laundered white clothing tends to yellow. If you add a small amount of blue dye, it tricks our eyes into thinking that the resulting reflected light is white. Generally an excess of bluing will wash out after the clothing is laundered a few times. Brighteners in detergents work on a similar principle  when exposed to ultraviolet light, such as in sunlight the electromagnetic radiation from the Daystar, not the brand of cleaning products, it fluoresces in the blue range, covering up the yellowing.

They may get annoyed because you are sort of directing them at their own job. I would think they have thought about when it is important to clean the slicer. If they are cutting in quick succession the same product for several people, there would not be a mixing of products. If there is an accumulation of bits and pieces from several food items, then your suggestion would be appropriate.

283,How dirty is a clean house to a forensic investigator who can use investigative equipment to find blood saliva and more,"That would depend on what they find. I have a young son so he'd probably find all kinds of nasty stuff just as in an elderly persons home would more than likely forensically dirtier than someone who can clean and pick up after themselves with more ease and comfort How dirty is a clean house to a forensic investigator who can use investigative equipment to find blood, saliva, and more? What are some new forensics investigation methods? Can a private investigator be sued for illegally entering home premises? What is the best way to clean up a bloody crime scene homicide with blood spilled everywhere if your intent is to get away with murder? What was the most disturbing case youve ever investigated? How can I get a private investigator to investigate my wife? There are different branches of forensics. If you are a qualified accountant you can get an extra qualification as a forensic accountant. You would be employed to find out where the companys money is disappearing to, and who is stealing it. I was involved in medical forensics until I retired. I was a senior specialist pediatrician, but I also have qualifications in obstetrics and gynecology. I have a 3 year Master of Forensic Medicine degree from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne. Separate from my day job, I saw victims of physical and sexual assault, and child abuse cases. I had to go to court on a regular basis to give evidence for the prosecution. I am still going to court a year after I retired I also have forensic witness training. I know of botanists who work in forensic botany. There are forensic psychiatrists, forensic psychologists, and forensic dentists. There are insect specialists who can tell how long a corpse has been dead based on the weather conditions, the amount of exposure of the corpse, the ambient temperature, and the type of maggots on the corpse. Different fly species prefer corpses at different levels of putrefaction. You wouldnt have thought a maggot would be that fussy There are forensic specialists who are trained police officers that collect evidence at crime scenes. Basically if you get a qualification after high school, there is probably some forensic aspect to it. Crime is everywhere. Any decent job requires extra training after you leave school. More training and qualifications, more interesting job, more money The alternative is to join the police and work your way up to detective. The other alternative is to be a private investigator, but a lot of private investigators are actually expolice, and most of what they do is tedious  like sitting in a car with a camera for hours waiting for someone to do the wrong thing. There are private detective training courses. The bottom line is you need more training after you leave school, and you need to complete year 12 with good marks. Good forensic work is slow and meticulous and has to stand up in court. I used to see 20  25 cases per year, but only appeared as prosecution witness 4  5 times per year. TV makes weeks or months worth of work appear to happen in 1 hour Forensics is quite fashionable right now, so there will be a lot of competition for training and jobs. P.S. Forensics can have its exciting moments  I know of 2 forensic people looking for clues after 2 different murders  1 in Queensland and 1 in NSW. Each was being helped by a friend of the victims family. It turned out in both cases that the helper was in fact the murderer, trying to find out what whether the forensic people were discovering incriminating evidence Each of the forensic people told me that they wonder what would have happened if they had found any incriminating evidence while they were alone with the murderer What does it take to become a forensic investigator? Will it be difficult to find a job as a private forensic investigator in NSW?

Photosynthesis is the main process in plant growth by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, CO2, and minerals into O2 and energyrich organic compounds.  ,  Due to dust plants are unable to take direct sunlight properly so this process get disturbed. Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction canters that contain green chlorophyll pigments.

297,How do I remove musty smell from a gas mask,"Questions first. Age? Type? Source? At a bet, Im thinking you bought one of somebodies army surplus respirators with ages off spec denatured cartridges. If these are the case, trash it. Cartridges have a posted expectation date, generally one year after removal from their original wrappers or actually past the stamped expiration date. This is a bandness thing. Get fresh cartridges, then follow the manufacturers recommended methodology for cleaning and maintenance. Then take a reputable Respiratory Protection Class and get fit tested by a trained professional. That is an annual thing by the way. How do I remove musty smell from a gas mask? Can a gas mask protect you from carbon monoxide? How do I remove cigarette smell from clothes? Im looking for something spray with a neutral scent that is small enough to carry. After I smoke and I get back into the bar, my clothes smell like cigarette. What is the best cheapest gas mask that can help filter radiation? Why does diesel gas smell good? What is the best way to remove gasoline odors? No. Absolutely not. You can smell molecules as small as a dozen atoms across. The smallest viruses are about ten times bigger than that and the SARSCov2 virus is about three times bigger still. N95 masks are designed to filter out 95 of virus sized particles, they dont filter out most things the size of molecules. In fact, thats why N95 and N100 or P100 masks for industrial used have those bulky cartridgesthose are filled with activated carbon or some other absorbent material designed to remove toxic chemicals until they become saturated. You will always be able to smell your surroundings through a filter mask at least to some extent, even if it has a fresh absorbent cartridge. Only a SCUBA type system like firefighters sometimes wear in which your breathing air comes from a tank will prevent your smelling much of your surroundings. The way to tell if youve put your mask on correctly it that it should fit tightly around your nose and mouth, and should be tight enough that its not easily pushed away when you exhale normally at rest. If you have a cheap disposable mask, it will have a wire over the bridge of your nose to help you shape it. If you have a more expensive mask, it will have adjustable straps. Better masks usually have exhaust valves that make them more comfortable, and these can usually be tested by blocking the valves and gently exhaling to ensure an airtight fit to the facehowever, if your mask has exhaust valves, it wont fully protect those around you from virus shed by you if you become ill. For more info on protective masks, Ive posted a video which among other things, includes links to training on proper use of various masks.  ,  If you can smell odors with a new N95 mask on, does that mean the mask was put on incorrectly? Its fairly difficult Youll never 100 mask the smell but theres a good few things that help As a teen, I constantly ran around doing everything I could to mask the smell of smoke so my parents didnt smell it, but for a couple of 40 somethings who had never smoked in their lives, they had amazing sense of smell Im not promoting smoking cigarettes because quite frankly its the worst thing I ever did, and if you find that opportunity to quit, do it But here goes..

It an burn your skin and eyes. Hard stuff to use to clean the toilet. So whatever else you had in the toilet mixed together and then turned blue.

What happens if a toilet cleaning acid touches body parts like the hand or foot? Without a plunger, what can you pour down a toilet to quickly break down feces that won't flush? Oh sweet mother of Pearl Two weeks ago, the toilet in one bathroom inexplicably to me got clogged and overflowed. I say inexplicably because that particular flush did not involve any solid waste. Of course it happened just before I went to bed late at night when my husband was out of town on business.  ,  It was a mess. Frantic plunging didnt help. After bailing the bowl out so it wouldnt flood anymore, I resorted to the internet to see what it had to offer. Heres what I found that didnt help me but might help you If you have a dishwasher, go get some of the detergent you use in it. I use these  ,  Dissolve a quantity of the dishwasher detergent in a cup of HOT water. I dissolved four pods. Dissolve the detergent completely. Once youve bailed out most of the bowl, pour the hot solution into the toilet bowl. Let it sit for a few minutes. Internet did not specify how long. I elected to give it 20 minutes. Now try plunging the toilet again. The idea is that the detergent in the dishwashing pods can work on whatever is stopping up your toilet enough to finally get it to flush. This might just work on your bar of soap. You may need to try plunging several times. Even if it doesnt work, the dissolved dishwasher detergent should do no harm. In my case, it didnt work and the next morning, after paying a plumber 92, I found out why  ,  You know those plastic measuring cups that come attached with shrinkwrap to bottles of NyQuil? Thats what was in my toilet. I evidently knocked it off the back of my toilet into the toilet bowl and flushed it without knowing it was there. We no longer keep bottles of cough syrup on the back of our toilet. Good luck. How can I solve a serious toilet clog bar of soap?

302,What are some ways to keep a small apartment clean with your partner,"First no pets, then not much stuff. Even food dont stockpile, reduce amount of everything like towels to only the amount needed. Remove shoes indoors and put each dirty dish in the dishwasher as it is used, Only have one set of pans, dishes and very few serving pieces. After using the shower wipe it down, wipe counter after use and wipe up any spills. Brush toilet bowl daily and wipe the rim, This means it doesnt need much actual cleaning and if you need to mop the floor it will be not very hard, What are some ways to keep a small apartment clean with your partner? How can I clean my bedroom and my bathroom in two weeks? What is deep cleaning in housekeeping? What is the best way to tell if a hotel room is really clean? Why am I not able clean my room? Do you know some useful cleaning tips? Having roommates is always a challenging experience. Cleaning can be handled in various ways depending upon the personalities of the people and how many share the apartment house. I will use four people as an example All chores are divided among the roommates. A schedule is created and posted on the refrigerator door. The chores are 1. Cleaning kitchen sink, counters, floor, tables, etc. to state health safety guidelinesthat means disinfected standard 2. Cleaning bathrooms sinks, tubs, showers, floors 3. Vacuuming all common areas daily other than kitchen and bathrooms 4. Removing trash, garbage and recycling daily to the outdoor collection area, replacing trash bags into containers and cleaning containers of any spills odors daily. With all chores for an entire week long, everyone does their share of cleanup. Slackers get fined a weeks rent by unanimous decision of the others. Chores rotate weekly. Other aspects can be added such as cooking .meals can be all together or everyone for themselves leading to a bigger mess. But the personality of the group is the deciding factor. When it gets to be so offensive that you cannot live without stress then either kick the slackers out, or move out yourself. If I went into too much detail then I apologize. So here is the BATHROOM alone Each roommate gets the bathroom cleanup as above for one week at a time, rotating weekly. It must be cleaned on a daily basisno exceptions. Bathmats need t be changed daily as well buy sets of 6 or 12, in white only, so they can be bleached. Avoid sharing anything such as towels, soap, toothbrush, etc. to avoid communicable diseases including fungus such as athletes foot. A daily dose of a bleach cleaner will help a lot in the tub, sink, floors 1.00 spray bottle at Dollar store, Walmart, others. Use paper towels or toilet paper to clean the toilets and then flush away to save on laundry as cleaning aids. Have a roll of paper towels on the counter or hanging at the sinks to avoid excessive laundry or use washcloths as hand towels to dry, packs of 18, white, cost under 4.00. Good luck. How do you keep your bathroom clean in a shared apartment? First and foremost, know what is necessary and what isnt. Keep your countertops as clear as possible so the space seems less cramped. The exception  a jar next to the stove for cooking utensils. Small apartments are typically limited in storage space, particularly in the kitchen. So, if you are just starting out, take advantage of that fact. You dont need a full set of cookware. One boiler pot with lid, one frying pan, and one or two baking pans. One for pizza and one for cookies Do you need mixing bowls? If so, would one be enough? This will save on costs and allow you to buy better quality as well. Make a point not to accumulate kitchenware unnecessarily. Buy a four set of dishes and be conservative with glasses. For some reason we get crazy collecting plastic cups. Nobody needs 50 cups. Be practical and strategic n your selection. Does it fit in your car cupholder? Does it have a lid with a straw built in? Then keep a favorite and liquidate the rest. Anything that helps you keep things streamlined and functioning is helpful when you have a small kitchen. Most stoves have a drawer below the oven that you can keep your pans in. Use it I also think investing in pull out shelving helps a lot. This allows for no space to go unused. Plus, you wont have to pull everything out to find the right thing. I.e. spices. If you have 20 or so on a shelf, you are going to spend too much time hunting for the right one. Just spend 10 on a pull out drawer shelf and you will be glad you did Plus, you can take them with you when you go. Fill your kitchen with what you actually use regularly and donate the rest. It will help you lead a more stressfree existence. I promise What are some ways to utilize a small apartment kitchen? Clutter and accumulation  Constantly purge stuff you havent used in 6 and 12 months. Just donate it or throw it out. Its never ending, just get used to doing it. Decluttering, organization and remaining lean need to become a hobby. If its over say 80 then maybe expend the effort to eBay it. Just take 1 week and get rid of massive amounts of stuff. EVERYTHING that remains MUST have a place To solve storage furniture cost problems, you can take up DIY furniture building with simple hand power tools. Get yourself a drill, impact driver, jigsaw, circular saw, 1 4 sheet sander and router  a plane, file set, hammer, etc. You can make every cutting jig you need from plywood to make very accurate and safe cuts to make amazingly good looking and functional furniture with just a few tools, plywood and pine framing lumber 2 x 4s, 2 x 6s, etc. When it becomes an obsession, step up to a table saw, miter saw, and planer to see your project results REALLY increase. Its all in the measurement and design SketchUp or Fusion 360, etc.. You will figure out how to make the cuts when the time comes. I can spend 12 days on design and rethinking in CAD, then only 5 to build and finish. With practice you can build any storage solution you could possibly need. This is the way people lived before IKEA. They actually made things they needed for themselves  Imagine that Personally, Ive even made rolling top and front access barrister book cases on jack caster platforms. They double as shelving and storage and can roll into a POD or UHaul truck so I never have to really pack or use boxes when I move. Stuff, toys, equipment, clothes and everything live in them and I stack them 8 feet tall with chalkboard paint on the fronts. Hand tools and frequently used items are all on rolling tool carts using first order storage design concepts. Meaning no drawers  everything is visible, has a place and can be grabbed from the storage position. My apartment is pretty big and spend almost all the day cleaning up, what can I do to keep it clean and not messy? How often should someone clean their room? How do I go about cleaning my dirty bedroom? Cleaning  Is having a clean house worth it? How do I clean my room properly? I have to clean my room because it really bothers me. To be honest, I don't have a place to put anything. My shelves are full and my desk is a nightmare and I don't want spiders coming out when I move furniture, etc. First of all, make yourself some rules. Everything you bring into your home must have more than one use. Find things that can be used in multiple ways a coffee table that can serve as an additional seat. A table that folds down, like a drop leaf, to make more room. A bed that opens up, or a sofa that converts to a bed. In addition, make your cleaning a routine that you do every day for a short period. One day for dusting. One day for vacuuming. One day for mopping. Or, get a Roomba and use that. There are also mopping robots. I love mine. There are myriad books and approaches to simplifying your possessions.  Keep your countertops and table free of clutter. Use covered baskets and stackable boxes for storage. The Container Store is excellent for items that will help in this regard and has a wide choice of styles. How do you keep a small apartment organized and clean? What are some ways to keep a small apartment clean with your partner?"
303,When is air duct cleaning necessary,"I almost never clean ducts. However I bought a house last year to use as a rental. The original owner was still living in it. And he was a chain smoker. I got the house cheap because the smoke smell was HORRID. Every fixture, every piece of woodwork, everything in the house had a brownish yellow patina on it from cigarette smoke. We repainted all the walls and ceiling with an oil based stain and odor blocking paint, then painted over that with latex paint. And we coated all the cabinetry what we left in the house, anyway with two coats of lacquer. Then we cleaned the ducts. Twice. And all the fins and stuff in the AC unit. Then we left an odor canceling bomb thingy in the AC unit and left the fan running for three months. Oh, and we had to rip out all the carpet and pads, and painted the same odor blocking paint on all the concrete flooring, then flooded the tile flooring parts of the house with ammonia and let it sit for a day, then scrubbed the floors and shop vacced it all out. Smells much better now. But there is still a hint of smoke smell. Probably from inside the walls. When is air duct cleaning necessary? What would cause mold spots in a new inslab PVC air duct even before the HVAC has been turned on for the first time and who bears the responsibility for its cleaning?

305,Is it better to spray AT 205 onto your car like Scotty Kilmer recommends with a full spray bottle like for Windex or with a smaller spray bottle such as for eyeglass cleaning solution,"Scotty is a knowledgeable man and most of the products that he recommends should do as he said. AT205 is used as an additive to your motor oil, transmission fluid, or steering fluid to stop leaks that are caused by rubber seals that have lost there rubberization therefore oil leaks out, but by adding AT205 into the system it reaches the rubber seals and adds a chemical back into the seal so that it rejuvenates it giving it the ability to form a good seal as long as the seal in not cracked or broken But you seem to be talking about a different application for the same product which my guess is treating rubber components with AT205 externally and indeed that will work on rejuvenating things like rubber wiper blades rubber components that seal the windows and doors etc. I have not seen the youtube video of Scotty using AT205 in that manner only internally mixing it with the motor oil, steering fluid, and transmission fluid where the AT205 is just poured straight in. Indeed if you are going to use AT205 on external rubbers to condition them a small spray bottle can be used or even a small paintbrush to coat the rubber without wasting it with overspray a small sponge will also work just fine. AT205 is not a cheap product to be spraying everywhere haphazardly so I would recommend using it with more control.

Grease consistency is rated from 000 very thin to 6 resembles a bar of soap. The oil could be the same in all of them of a given brand, but maybe 2 thickener in the 000 and 80 in the number 6.

307,What type of exposure to asbestos is caused by actions such as sweeping dusting or unfiltered vacuuming,"Inhalation breathing of asbestos and other mineral fibers are known to cause lung cancer. In most parts of the world, only low levels of these fibers are present in the environment to cause any significant adverse health impacts. Even though many uses of asbestos have been banned in the U. S. starting in 1973, it continues to be used in gaskets, friction products, roofing materials, fireproofing materials and other products that are used every day. What type of exposure to asbestos is caused by actions such as sweeping dusting or unfiltered vacuuming? Does pressure washing an asbestos roof pose an health risk? Which is the most dangerous type of asbestos? Why are asbestos sheets corrugated? Who is at the most risk from asbestosrelated diseases? Does rock wool insulation contain asbestos? There are really no steps for asbestos removal that should be undertaken by a homeowner.  Once asbestos, like lead based paint, was declared a hazardous material by the EPA, an entirely new enterprise was created, and HAZMAT abatement companies came into being and flourished.n nAsbestos abatement is expensive, which is why you often see old structures that are covered with asbestos shingles just being covered over with a new siding material.  Asbestos presents no danger unless it is damaged or pulverized into fine enough particles that become airborne and are breathed in.n nThe most likely sources of asbestos in the home that could eventually create a problem, are old pipe and duct insulation and 'popcorn' ceiling finishes.  Either of these uses may over time begin to deteriorate and become airborne.  Asbestos floor tile and the mastic used to adhere it are mostly benign and only pose a potential problem during demolition.  Spraying water on the material as it is being removed, to eliminate dust, eliminates the risk.n nI have done quite a large number of asbestos abatement projects and the procedures for disposing of the waste are as problematic as the removal.  Each bag of material must be tagged, logged on a manifest, signed off by someone in authority that has had training and is certified for handling the waste material.  You don't just throw it into a dumpster.n nIf you are concerned that you have an asbestos problem in your home you should call an asbestos abatement company.  They will collect samples and have them tested and if positive, will present you with an abatement proposal.  Be aware, however, that once the crew in their 'space suits' show up and all the regulatory postings and placards go up with the skull and crossbones on them, you are going to attract a lot of attention.  The local evening news programs thrive on these events and you can bet there will be a close up of your house with the warning signs prominently displayed.n nSo, unless what you think is asbestos isn't really a threat, you might want to consider all your options before having it removed.

Now if all of this might seem overwhelming, hire a professional  What is involved in an end of lease cleaning process? Primarily, the best tip is Do a deep and thorough cleaning of absolutely everything. Dont use cleaning agents that will harm finishes, such as abrasives which will dull or erode surfaces, or liquid cleaners on wood unless theyre specifically designed for wood surfaces, or strong chemicals such as lye, bleach or others, unless theyre either diluted, or unless theyre meant specifically for a particular application. Clean under, and behind the stove, refrigerator, and any other appliance that can be moved. Change furnace filters if applicable, and any water filters inline filters, refrigerator, etc. Windows should be cleaned spotless inside and out with a streakfree window cleaner. Turn off refrigerator and freezer, and allow them to come to room temperature. Then clean the interiors with a mild detergent, and finish by wiping them with mixture of 1 cup chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water. Leave the doors open to prevent mildew. Clean the interior of the stove and the stovetop to remove any black, burnedon food oil grease. Dont forget to clean tops of molding around doors, windows, picture rail, etc., as well as the tops of doors and window sashes. Have carpets professionally cleaned.

Are you responsible to keep the gardens and walks weed free? Are the outbuildings sheds, garage, etc. clean and tidy? Tools rakes, mower, shovels, hoses, etc. cleaned and properly stored? Find the inspection report that was done when you moved in, and read it carefully. Make sure that you have returned the place to the exact same condition, or better, that it was when you moved in. During your initial walkthrough its likely that your landlord took photos. If s he didnt share them with you, ask for a set, and use those photos to compare with the way your place looks now. Except for reasonable wear and tear, you should restore the place to a condition that is as good or better than the pictures. What are the tips for the end of lease cleaning? End of Lease Cleaning The real estate who manages the property will send an agent to come and do a final inspection upon the end of the tenancy agreement and ensure the property is thoroughly cleaned. If it is not up to standard they can request to take money from the initial deposit bond that was put down at the beginning of the lease. This is huge weight on tenants shoulders during an already stressful moving time, that is why often tenants will choose to outsource this task to a professional cleaning service that specialises in these End of Lease Cleans.

When it comes to your skin, it will wear off in a week or so as the surface skin cells are shed. So where skin is concerned, it can often be best to avoid getting carried away trying to get the stuff off all at once and just letting time take care of it. If the dog or cats fur has dried varnish on it, depending on where the varnish is located, it can be perfectly ok to just let time take care of that too, but you can trim the fur away if necessary. Itll grow back. When its on walls, well, you can just sand it down and after that, you either touch up the areas or paint them all over again. Carpet can often be a much bigger problem because the only thing I know thatll dissolve cured polyurethane is a paint remover product. Any paint remover is likely to severely damage the carpet. Itll melt some backings, melt the glue that holds backing and carpet together and it could also melt some carpet fibres. Even if the carpets wear surface is able to tolerate paint remover, the rest of the carpet may not fare too well. Its a risky thing to try. But if it is a pile carpet and the dried varnish is only on the very surface of it, you may be able to carefully trim just enough of the tips of the pile away so the varnish is gone and the low spot thus created isnt obvious. Duckbill scissors are a gadget thats often used for applique sewing but they were originally designed for trimming carpet pile. A pair of these scissors can make this particular task so much easier. If dried varnish is soaked into some of the carpet, then it may be possible to cut such spots out and replace them with patches cut to fit. One way to find patch material is to take it from some area of the rug that is normally hidden  like, from under the couch, maybe?. If you have broadloom and you had the foresight to keep the leftover pieces from the job, thats a great way to find a patch and a very good reason to keep those pieces stored just in case. Just carefully cut out a neat square or rectangle that removes the entire affected spot and fill the hole with a patch cut to precisely the same size. You can use a strong tape along all the edges to hold it in place. Carpet pros use heat activated adhesive on a strip to make permanent patches but tape will work.

By the book Continually Whether ashore or aboard ship, cleaning is carriedon like lives depended on it. Which they do. The following is an excerpt from this reference, which is dated and may have been superseded  INTRODUCTION. Cleaning is the first step in preventing aircraft corrosion and wear. Dirt, salt air deposits, and other contaminants can promote rapid corrosion and wear of aircraft surfaces, and can have an adverse impact on aircraft systems performance. Effective cleaning requires knowledge of the appropriate materials and methods needed to remove these contaminants. REASONS FOR CLEANING. Aircraft should be cleaned regularly in order to na. Prevent corrosion by removing salt deposits, other corrosive soils, and electrolytes nb. Maintain visibility through canopies and windows nc. Allow a thorough inspection for corrosion and corrosion damage nd. Maintain turbine engine efficiency ne. Reduce fire hazards by the removal of accumulations of leaking fluids nf. Improve overall appearance ng. Ensure aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft and nh. Maintain special paint scheme characteristics. FREQUENCY OF CLEANING. All aircraft shall be cleaned according to schedules required by the parent service organization. Navy aircraft shall be cleaned in accordance with the schedule in the aircraft specific manual.  23.1.  23.2.  When an ashore Navy aircraft should be cleaned, at least how often? How is it ensured on an aircraft carrier that aircraft doesn't overshoot? What is the duration for a deployed aircraft carrier to stay out at sea? I am joining the Navy as an aviation machinists mate and just want to know how long do aircraft carriers stay out at sea. How are airforce fighter planes different from that of the navy? Why is an aircraft carrier so important to nations navy and its armed forces capabilities? Why Indian Air force doesn't support indigenous aircraft like navy does? Landing on a carrier requires a level of precision seldom found in any other aviation field. When you start your pass at 3 4 of a mile about 1518 seconds from touchdown, to see a centered ball also known as the Meatball  a glide slope indicator located on the carrier, you need to fly your head through a window about 40 high give or take. When crossing the back of the ship about 2 seconds before touchdown, that window has shrunk to about 1.5 feet. You are literally positioning your aircraft to fly your eyeballs through a window 18 inches high at around 140180 miles per hour to still see a centered ball and catch the desired wire. All the while, your extremely short landing area much more difficult to line up on than a 12,000 runway is steadily moving to the right, since its angled away from the ships centerline. So you are having to make constant lineup corrections. Now add a pitching deck, night time, bad weather, and the occasional aircraft emergency, and you have the recipe for one buttclenching gutcheck. Quick disclaimer  if I say He in this post, assume I mean He She. Women are fully integrated into Naval Aviation, and there is zero difference in capability or competence. Needless to say, it takes an ENORMOUS amount of preparation to learn how to do this at all, and to continue to do it consistently, safely, and efficiently every day sometimes multiple times per day. As a student jet pilot, anyone in the jet pipeline also E2 C2 turboprop students will conduct their first carrier landing in the T45 Goshawk . From the very first flight, you are learning to Fly the Ball. Almost all Navy Bases especially the ones hosting carrierbased squadrons have a fresnel lens Optical Landing System  most commonly called the Meatball or Ball device next to the runway, with a carrier box painted at each end.  ,   ,  The Carrier Box is outlined in red above. Its just a tiny part of a normal runway, and the only lighted part during night Field Carrier Landing Practice FCLP. The Optical Landing System OLS, commonly known as the Ball or Meatball shown above. There is a very similar system mounted on a stabilized platform near the aircraft carrier landing area. The yellow light in the center moves up and down as an aircraft moves high or low on the desired glide slope. Ideally, you want the ball centered between the horizontal green datum lights this picture shows what the pilot would see if he were getting quite low on the approach. While the ball looks like a line here, it blossoms into a round blob when viewed from the air at typical landing distances. Standing this close to the ball, you would easily see it move if you ducked your head or stood on your toes  it is VERY sensitive as you get close. The Landing Signal Officer holds onto a special controller called a Pickle Switch that lets him flash the cut lights clearing the pilot to land without a radio call, or illuminate the wave off lights if an unsafe development occurs pilot out of safe parameters, or an unsafe landing environment on the carrier.  ,   ,  EVERY time you land at a runway equipped with a meatball, you fly that meatball. The T45 Goshawk training pipeline has many phases, Basic Instruments, Familiarization Flights, Aerobatics, Formation, Formation Aerobatics, Bombing, Gunnery, Advanced Instruments, Road Reconnaissance, Low Level Flight, basic dogfighting, etc etc. I think it worked out to a couple of hundred hours of flight time and many, many flights most flights are 1 to 1.5 hours max  you do the math. Regardless of what type of flight you are on, when you get back to the field, you will normally fly 710 landings, using the meatball each time, meticulously graded by your instructor when you have one  you start flying solo quite a lot the farther you progress. So you start flying the ball early, and you fly it as many times as you possibly can through all the training phases. There are a couple of things going on here. First, you are building time in the jet, getting to the point where you can fly it without thinking about it much, where your hands are moving unconsciously on the controls to make it do what you want it to do. Second, you are learning how to get to a good start with a centered ball, how to recognize deviations, and how to correct those deviations with the right amount of control power inputs not too much, not too little. You have to practice, practice, practice over hundreds and hundreds of landings. About halfway through the T45 training, you will fly midphase FCLPs Field Carrier Landing Practice. You fly a series of dedicated flights where the entire focus is flying the ball. I remember them all being solo flights. Same runway, same meatball, but now there is a Landing Signals Officer or Paddles a pilot instructor qualified to wave jets aboard an aircraft carrier colocated with that meatball, who is watching every phase of the pass, providing landing clearance he she actually takes control of the runway away from the tower, and  most importantly  grading every pass. Groups of students go through this together, so each FCLP flight will typically involve 610 jets with a solo student at the controls. I would say 1015 landings are usually conducted by each student at some point you get diminishing returns, followed by an LSO debrief for each individual. These debriefs are EXTREMELY detailed the LSO misses nothing. Trend analysis is discussed, along with how to correct for persistent issues. This is basically a spot check on how students are progressing halfway through the course, while there is still time to progress and improve.  ,  FCLP, with Landing Signal Officers observing. Note the back seat is empty.  ,  As you approach the end of your T45 training, it will be time to go to the boat There is something crazy about this that I did not even find out until I was about halfway through the program. A little background  as a student, EVERY time you try something for the first time, you are with an instructor. Normally, if you perform well enough, you progress on to solo flights. So I had lots of solo time flying aerobatics single and on an instructors wing, bombing, night flights, instrument hops, crosscountries, etc etc, but ALL of them involved trying it with an instructor first. Turns out, the FIRST time a student lands on a real aircraft carrier, they are  I couldnt believe it the first time I heard it. But it makes sense when you think about it. The safety margins are much higher for students going to the boat for the first time. The weather has to be decent, the sea state not too rough, the crosswinds not too high, etc. But there is still that part about landing a jet on a postage stamp You are solo because there can be NO DOUBT who got that plane aboard. A short while later, that pilot is going to HAVE to be able to do it in the worst conditions, with only one engine functioning. That is not the time to find out he only qualified at the boat because his instructor in the back seat felt bad and was giving him help either verbal or otherwise. This is the ultimate gutcheck, the Navys way of kicking you out of the nest, and the absolute pinnacle of your time as a student. It is utterly terrifying, but also exhilarating. You have no idea how well you will do, and there are no guarantees. Some pass, some fail and have to try again. You may get a second chance if you fail once, and if you fail that, you may never fly again. You could spend 8 years of your life getting ready for this working hard in high school, getting a Naval Academy appointment, getting a flight billet, getting a jet slot, get 99 of the way through, and BAM You mess up at the boat and there is the end of your dream. Needless to say, the stakes here are ENORMOUS. Before the training command unleashes a horde of grimfaced, steelyeyed students at a hapless aircraft carrier, there is still a lot of work to do. Its time for another round of FCLPs, and this time its for real. Your LSO is now the same instructor who will be standing on the flight deck waving you aboard. There are no excuses for bad landings by this point  you have flown the entire jet syllabus by now with the possible exception of dogfighting. You meet the minimum standards, or she will not take you to the boat. Period. Over the course of those FLCPs, the LSO learns your trends and develops a good idea of whether you are ready or not. As a student, you also get comfortable with her as well. It will be nice hearing a familiar voice during the chaos of the Big Game.  ,   ,  Your LSO is your friend . . .  ,   ,  You are never going to be as comfortable in the jet as you are now, and you might have 1000 landings of experience. You need both, because the first time you roll out behind a real aircraft carrier, most of your brain cells will be busy freaking out and trying to make your butt suck up your seat cushion. But there will be 2 tiny neurons who recall their duty, keeping those hands moving, making hamfisted corrections to that dancing meatball. It wont be pretty, but for most its enough.  ,  T45C Cockpit shot. This is most likely an instructor at the controls. That first day at the boat, you will normally perform a couple of hookup touch and goes, and if memory serves 5 arrested landings. Youll normally come back the next day and knock out 5 more. If your grades are good enough, you pass and are the king of the world. If not, you put on a brave face and go buy some rounds for the folks who did. Hopefully the board will find in your favor and let you try again. After all this, you get your Wings of Gold. They mean a great deal. Next, you travel to a training squadron. Time to strap on a real fleet aircraft. It is here that you will fly your first night carrier landings. Towards the end of the program. you will fly another round of FCLPs until you are ready to go to the boat. Except this time, many of the FCLPs are at night, with all the runway lights turned off except for that tiny carrier box. Ironically, we mostly still flew a day pattern  the night work was really to work on your scan flying a day approach turn, which is very dynamic, with extremely precise checkpoints around the turn. Simulators are used to prepare for actual night Case III approaches, and generally are very good for that, since it is mostly instrument flying. Simulators are generally terrible at replicating the experience of actually flying the ball, however. You need to be in the real aircraft, flying an actual glideslope. FCLPs dont replicate all aspects of landing on the carrier either there is a lot of crazy air movement behind the boat that can REALLY affect the approach, but they get you as close as you can get on land.  ,  Night FCLP  ,  When you actually get to the boat, you have to obtain a certain number of touch and goes and day traps before you start your night landings. I dont remember the exact amounts, but they vary based on how long it has been since your last night landing. At this point, youve never had a night landing, so you will be getting plenty of day traps ahead of time. Now its time for your second big gut check Night landings are another level of buttpucker altogether. But at this point you KNOW you can land on a carrier. You faced the beast once and survived. Someone thought enough of you to put wings of gold on your chest You have more flight time now, and your confidence grows exponentially with each trap. I dont remember my first night trap being nearly as scary as my first day trap, even though it was more difficult. However, this is definitely one of those Your Mileage May Vary situations.  ,   ,  Once you make it past this hurdle, you head off to a fleet squadron. At some point, it will be time to head back to the boat with them. It will follow the same pattern day and night FCLP practice with squadron LSOs, followed by day carrier touch and goes, day traps, and finally night traps. The numbers again depend on how long its been since the pilots got their last night traps. For a squadron just getting ready to go back to the boat after a year, it will be a lot of landings. If they just finished a workup phase at the boat a month before, it will be less but not zero. In general, to be allowed to make a routine night carrier landing, you have to have a night carrier landing within the last 7 days. If you exceed that by a little, you will need to get a couple of day traps, followed shortly after that by some night traps. Wait too long, and you will have to conduct FCLPs on the beach. This is why during a deployment, the flight schedule usually runs from about 11 or 12 in the morning to about midnight or 1 AM. There needs to be night landing opportunities each day, so that squadrons can rotate their pilots through the night hops to reset that 7 day clock. Think about it  after all that training, this is a skill set that is still so difficult, we turn into pumpkins after only 7 days. Now to address a couple of questions and observations from the other answers No, the LSOs dont move the Meatball during FCLPs. No MOVLAS that I remember that would not help for training the fly the ball. Just having a ball to fly is enough remember, we are learning to fly our eyeballs through an 18 window. Arresting gear set up on a normal runway has no bearing on training for the boat. They are completely different animals. At a regular airfield, they are purely for safety. Small jets can be very squirrely on the runway  we land fast, do not have reverse thrust, have tiny little landing gear footprints, etc. If we have an emergency that could compromise our ability to control the jet on the runway engine, flap, landing gear, wheel brake, antiskid, and nose wheel steering malfunctions to name a few, we will drop our hook and catch the wire, which helps slow the jet down and keeps it on the runway. This is called catching the shortfield gear. There is often another arresting cable set up on the far end of the runway the Long Field Gear that can be a nice insurance policy during takeoff if a highspeed abort goes south  just drop the hook before you run off the end of the runway. The short and long field gear are MUCH more gentle that the carrier wires, spooling out for hundreds of feet. They are normally a couple thousand feet down the runway, not very close to the meatball. Fun side note some Air Force fighters actually have small tail hooks for this reason and this reason alone. They could not land on the carrier, because they dont roll up their flight suit sleeves, they wear weird cravat scarf things around their necks, and they play golf all day while complaining that the bidet is on the fritz in their hotel room. Just kidding  its because their Air Force jets arent built for those forces, and why carry that extra weight if you dont have too? Im not worried about insulting my Air Force brothers and sisters, because no one could possibly STILL be reading this by now . . .  ,  How do Navy Pilots practice aircraft carrier landings before they actually land on an aircraft carrier? When an ashore Navy aircraft should be cleaned, at least how often?"

316,Is there a way to revert the damage done to the environment by tons of detergents And what can we do individually to make a difference,"In 1972 I was testing detergents for biodegradability. I added a standard solution of detergent to sewage and measured the biodegradation using a foam test. All of the detergents I tested degraded well in sewage. So, if your washing water is going into your sewerage, you should not have to worry about contaminating rivers. There should be no other part of the environment affected by detergents in meaningful amounts. If your concern is with phosphates causing algal blooms and lake eutrophication, buy a phosphate free detergent. If you have some other reason to be concerned as I don't know your situation from your question, you should write to your City Council or your government representative. There should be good legislation in place to prevent contamination of the environment, and use of nonbiodegradable detergents and surfactants such as fluorinated types should be strictly limited. Is there a way to revert the damage done to the environment by tons of detergents? And what can we do individually to make a difference? When is decomposition not good for the environment? Does detergent for dark clothes work? Why All soaps are detergents but all detergents are not soap? How do we eliminate laundry detergent white specks from washed clothes? Moving into a new home, what brands of cleaning detergent are recommended? Too much detergent will make clothes smell by the simple reality that a single rinse of the usual cycle is  In order to register the scent of anything, microscopic airborne particles of that very thing are inhaled. Dont think about that too hard as the realization of someone breaking wind will be quite cringy. However, residual detergent stuck in the clothing after washing and baked in with the dryer will offfume from your clothing and tattle its presence. I wont even get started on the purposeful coating that fabric softener adds in order to make clothing, sheets, and towels feel softer. Detergent is used to make water  If anyone wants their clothing to be clean and fresh, namely without residual odors, then use the prescribed amount of detergent or LESS if clothing is lightly soiled by a days usage. Skip the fabric softener evil useless invention for some of us who cant deal with perfumes and add 1 2 to a full cup of white vinegar with the start of the rinse cycle. The light acid will freshen by removing residual soap and, surprisingly, soften the feel of most fabrics. Vinegar is also much cheaper to use and the nosewrinkle smell disappears quickly in the dryer or openair versus detergents. One last vital bit of reality if someone is passing on that clothing whiffs strongly of detergent, take them at their word. Our ability to smell anything that is constantly present eventually creates nose blindness. You stop smelling the very thing that is causing another hapless soul, new to scenting the problem, to reel back. Fix the problem. Use less. Can too much detergent make clothes smell?

323,Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them,"Possible, but its only 20 a sheet so if your time is worth anything, just toss the old stuff like everyone else does. Reusing it would be more like an archeology dig than a construction site. Youd need to find each drywall screw with a little tilty magnet thing or some electronic studfinders can do that hopefully there are screws and not nails, uncover it, use a razor knife to get the taping mud out of the philips head indent, unscrew it wash, rinse, repeat. 32 to 38 times per sheet. You probably want to keep track of where each sheet went, since they were cut and screwed for where the studs and electrical boxes were behind them. Reinstalling them runs the risk of the new screws going past the paper surface, if you resuse the same screw locations. If that keeps happening, move the screw location an inch up the same stud. A screw only counts as holding the sheet to the wall and providing the mandated sheer strength if you DONT punch through the paper, it should be to just barely below the surface of the paper. And, jeez, then theres the tape that was applied over the joints. Youd have to remove that. You could cut it with a razor knife, but you need to get under it to remove those screws. It peels off easily enough but often takes the drywall paper surface with it. Without that intact paper on both sides, its not codecomplaint drywall. If you dont remove the old tape, then the new seams will be quite high compared to the field and really hard to disguise with texturing. If you succeed in reusing it, I suspect youll want a heavy hand while mudding it and then apply a pretty thick, forgiving texture to hide all the mishaps that occurred. Oh, and youll have to remove it in the order it was installed. We always applied the ceilng sheets first. Youd have to be a completely newbie not to. So you need to remove all the walls first before attempting the ceiling, because the ceiling sheets to pinched to the ceiling joists by the upper sheets on the wall. And youll need at least two braces to support the ceiling pieces as you work, or, as you get down to the last few screws, half the sheet will fall and crack down the middle. If it was installed with screws, you MIGHT be able to nail it if you work very carefully. If it was installed with nails, youre screwed because you cant get those out with totally bunging up the drywall beyond any possibility of reuse. So maybe start there  find 2 or 3 of them, dig down, and see if they used drywall screws or drywall nails.

What are three weird ways to repair a 6 inch hole in a drywall wall? Should I use a mesh drywall tape? Is drywall repair expensive? Yes it is possible but labor intensive. You haven't clearly described the scope of your project so the best I can offer is a general process. There are two aspects that you will have to deal with screws and taped joints. In essence, you will be deconstructing the wall by reversing the installation process. First locate the drywall screws in the area you want to remove. This is easily accomplished with a stud finder and a magnet. Use the stud finder to locate the studs and pass the magnet over the stud location to locate the screws. Use a powered screwdriver to drill down to and remove the drywall screws. It's more efficient to scan the entire area, locating studs and marking screws, then go back and remove all the screws.  ,  Your drywall will be corner taped at the seam where the wall meets the ceiling and flat taped at the seams between drywall sheets. You have to cut through these seams to remove the drywall. You can identify the location of flat taped seams by the presence of double screws together on a stud. The seam is between the screws. Reinstalling the drywall is the reverse process attaching with screws and taping the joints.  ,  Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Hello Stef, it  The labour involved is timeconsuming and labourious. If you decide to try nothing ventured, nothing gained then turn the boards upside down which would theoretically prevent attempting to screw through the same holes. My best adviuce is to replace it, if you are doing it yourself, it isnt too expensive and removing it will give a clear understanding of how it was installed, what problems lie beneath and the chance to fix any other underlying problems. I would stress that you use a cable finder to locate any wires, conduits, cables etc. in case you damage them in the process. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Is it possible? Yes. For my sins I have a couple of times taken off drywall and replaced it. It meant finding and marking every nail screw, repeatedly sharpening the end of a piece of copper pipe it is what I had available to punch a hole around each fastener, slicing the tape and peeling it, and lifting off the sheets. Replacement meant using fasteners in different locations, and lots of mudding not lots of mud. Possible does not mean desirable. But sometimes you have lots of time and no money.

Is drywall repair expensive? How much does it cost to repair a drywall? How do I fix a bad drywall job that has been painted? Do windows go in before or after drywall? Can waterdamaged drywall be repaired, or does it have to be replaced? If it is possible you can lay down a new floor, cement, sand, pea size gravel, screed, around 70 to 100 mm thick, then removing and replacing dry wall would a good thing. The reason I mention floor is, first you cover the floor and walls with a pvc membrane, then over that you lay the new floor you take the membrsne as high as possible up rhe walls, and after a few days, when the floor has cured, got hard and dry, you can do the drywall using foil back plaster board or whatever you prefer. It will be no good simply taking the old away and replacing it, without curing the wet or dampness problem, will be a waste of your time and money. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Hello, I am not certain that I fully understand the question However, if you have damaged drywall or need to remove someone, in order to access the foundation walls, it is common practice to replace it. Drywall is not really a wall. The structure is either wood or metal framing and the so called Drywall  s just the Gypson Sheetrock sheeting that makes up the wall finish. Also the sheet rock walls in a basement are usually only a way to divide and finish the space and usually has no structural value to your home. Hope this helps Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Well, no but in a way, yes. You only get to remove GWB sheetrock. Once its pulled from the wall it is broken, cracked, damaged, has nail screw holes through it and is beyond practical repair. So you just replace it with new GWB sheetrock. I just finished doing that to a few walls in a house I renovated. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Yes if it is say a patch where you remove a small area and repair electrical or lumping .If you cut carefully and save piece removed it can be done , or if removed area is to beat up or damaged install new piece of drywall.Needs appropriate backing and fastenings as well as retapped and mud .if you are talking about removing large area where the drywall comes off in pieces , you might as well remove old and install new board. if its less work to install new ? Or easier to repair old ? Both work Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? It can be done but, thats a lot of work and it probably break in many pieces, if it was nailed with many nails. If it was glue to the studs, you will not be able to salvage it. Also, if it comes out in many pieces, it will be more work mudding it and finishing it. It is a lot easier to put new one even if it cost more. It does not worth the aggravation to try to save the rock. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? a small area maybe, but in general you would be entering into a nightmare. If you provide all the labor for free your question tells me your experience level and only paid for materials you would soon find that its a terrible idea. Drywall installation for beginners is a challenge using new rock. I doubt you could even hire anyone willing to attempt this.

Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? Possible, but more expensive than just buying new drywall. Use a sawzall to cut the drywall off along the studs avoid wires and pipes. Sister in new studs to support the narrower drywall. Lots of work. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? If the drywall hasnt been taped you could do this fairly easily. Once the joints have been taped and the screws covered over it will be near impossible to do and just starting over with new materials will be far easier. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? What makes more sense is to remove it, cut off the bad bits, and reinstall the good bits, and fill in the rest with fresh drywall. Its cheap enough. Use the recycled bits for the odd shaped parts like above doors or odd corners or around windows. Suing whole sheet 4x8 on flat expanses saves mudding and taping lots of little bits. Is it possible to remove your basement drywall if you need to and put them back again after repairing them? It is not practical to remove and reuse drywall . You would remove the old drywall by breaking it up and removing all the fasteners from the wall studs and ceiling joists . You would then install new drywall and tape and finish all the joints .

For allcotton sheets, used as directed, it does very little harm but if youre not the type to measure it carefully  if you just dump some in, say, then that sure can do a lot of damage over some time and it will wear fabrics out well before they should wear out. However, where there is a need to disinfect sheets, bleaching them may just be the best way to do that. Ive even used it on some lighter colours at half the usual amount on occasion if I wanted to deodorize the bedding. Bleach damages many synthetic fibres more than it damages cotton, so its not a good idea to use it if your sheets contain polyester. If there are stains or odours you can use it once in awhile and itll be ok, but dont use it often and use as little as you can while still getting the results you want. Bleach is also very, very hard on anything made of any type of rayon  think bamboo or Tencel. It just isnt necessary to bleach every time you wash but you certainly can if you want to.

Do they use the same kind of bleach we use for cleaning when they bleach grain for industrial baking? If so, how is it not toxic to us? How does bleach lighten colors in clothes? White cotton sheets yellow or lose brightness with use. Chlorine bleach will whiten and sanitize, although sanitizing is rarely called for. You shouldnt use bleach every time they are washed. It weakens the fibers, as well as the elastic on fitted sheets. If you have a sensitive nose, chlorine odor may linger in the sheets until the next washing. There are other ways to make white sheets look brighter. Laundry bluing Should you add bleach when washing white sheets? You can if you like, but I dont think its necessary unless they have stains and or are dingy. I like to use regular detergent and hot water. If colors are in the wash, Ill use warm instead, but its ideal to do whites separately in hot water. When using bleach, make sure to follow the directions. Should you add bleach when washing white sheets? its quite usual to add a little bleach for whites and sheets, probably a eggcup full in a normal size home wash, however too much use of bleach will damage and shorten the life of the material Should you add bleach when washing white sheets? Will scrubbing baking soda or Borax on a freshly bleachcleaned shower floor remove the bleach odors? What would make bed sheets feel rough after washing them? What shouldn't you mix bleach with? Does nonchlorine bleach sanitize or disinfect laundry at all? Does hot water make bleach not work? No, I dont. I found out the hard way that 100 cotton sheets dont last nearly as long if you bleach them. I wash mine regularly in warm water. If yours are not bright white any longer, you can put a little oxyclean in the wash occasionally. Should you add bleach when washing white sheets? If they have become dingy looking, this will restore them to bright white again. Just dont use too much bleach, as this will weaken the cotton fibers. And maybe dont bleach every time unless they are stained, as this might shorten the life of the sheets. Should you add bleach when washing white sheets?

Its extremely unlikely that a car could be running too long at any given time, because the interval for routine maintenance is usually at least fifty to a hundred hours of running time , or three to six thousand or more miles. Just about everybody cuts a car or truck off after a few hours, maybe a full work shift, except in the case of vehicles in the north where its REALLY cold, and turning them off means you might not get them started again until spring. If theres a smell of burning rubber coming from under the hood of a car, you should cut it off IMMEDIATELY, because it may be about ready to burst into flames. The odds are that some rubber or plastic part is touching the exhaust manifold, which is sometimes hot enough to set such things on fire. Such parts are usually clamped in place, but sometimes the clamps fail, and its very common for a less than meticulous mechanic to leave some of them off. SOMETIMES engines leak a small amount of oil, which also gets onto hot parts, and smells. Theres hardly ever enough of such oil leakage to result in a fire, because motor oil is hard to ignite, and theres usually only a drop or two once in a few minutes to hours. Such leaks CAN result in fires, but they rarely actually do so. The reason is that theres normally nothing flammable close enough to the hot manifold for one or two drops of oil to start it burning. You can smell the oil burning off  not in flames though and this smell could easily be interpreted as the smell of burning rubber. Such leaks should be promptly fixed because eventually they get worse and worse, and lead to other problems, such as damage to insulated wires, hoses, and belts. And if youre going to fix the leak anyway, you might as well fix it before you buy more oil just so it can leak out. Is it possible that a car could smell like burnt rubber under the hood if its been running too long? 6.

You can use your salad spinner and its basket to wash the spinach or other greens,  Rinse and agitate the spinach in plenty of cold water. The first step gets most of the dirt and grit off the spinach and plumps the leaves. Lift the leaves out of the dirty water. Change the water to remove dirt suspended in the water, as well as grit and dirt that settles to the bottom of the basin or sink. Rinse and agitate the leaves in cold salt water. Salt in the water softens the water, reducing surface tension, making the water wetter so that agitating the leaves in salty water does a better job of loosening and washing away any remaining grit, sand and dirt. Lift the leaves out of the dirty salt water. Change the water to get the salt off the leaves. Rinse and hold a few minutes in fresh water. The fresh water rinse removes salt and will plump up the leaves. Lift the leaves out of the water. Use the spinner to remove as much water as possible. Shake and loosen the leaves, then spin again.

I take it out and replace it if I find it gets overly damp from the leaves. Lot of trouble? Yes. Thats why those smart people who figured out how to pack clean dry spinach leaves loosely in a plastic tub can get those smart prices for their productall you have to do with that stuff is put the whole tub in the fridge, and use it when you like.

Why wouldnt washing and then using a salad spinner multiple times do the trick? What is the best way to clean fresh spinach to get rid of the lingering grit? I try to limit the amount of water I waste, so I rinse individual leaves over an empty bowl by dribbling a slow stream of cool water over each leaf, from wide to narrow top to bottom? so as not to spread the grit around. As each leaf is cleaned I lay it on a dishtowel for a couple of minutes and then turn it over for a couple more. It goes directly into the salad bowl or cooking pan from there. The water then gets used on potted plants. The reason I dont soak it in a pan of water for any time is that it absorbs water and gets limp more quickly than with a speedy rinse. Spinach is grown in sandy soil, and some of that grit will meander down toward the root. If youre growing your own, it helps to cut the bunch about an inch above the soil by clasping the whole bunch and slicing it with a quick swipe of a sharp knife. Then you can shake it gently to dislodge remaining grit. My grandmother used to then spray it gently with a sprinkler before putting it on a dishtowel. She never did have to rinse it off in the house. The other advantage to growing your own organically is that you dont have to deal with pesticides, and the rinse is thus focused on the grit and not what folks have sprayed on the spinach.

Having worked at an organic farm that grew spinach and greens, they literally had a washing machine that they used exclusively for rinsing greens. This works particularly well because washing machines will drain the water from the bottom of the machine along with the dirt and sand  and because you get the leaf separation and agitation cycles to shake the dirt and sand particles from the leaves. Was I surprised that they did this? Yes, but then I thought about it and it made perfect sense.

What is the best method to clean dirt sand off spinach? Why wouldnt washing and then using a salad spinner multiple times do the trick? Hi Barbara. This may seem a little strange to you, but Ive found it to be a fairly good way to get the grit out of fresh spinach. Actually, I discover this process a number of years ago when I was working in my shop. Id run out of fine grit sand paper so I took some sand paper that was a medium grit and sanded it with another piece of sand paper that was a little grittier and ended up with a fine grit sand paper. Then one day while I was harvesting the spinach out of my garden, my wife complained about there being a lot of dust and sand grit oh on the leaves even after shed thoroughly washed them. Thats when my old sand paper trick came to mind. So I went out to my work shop and got a piece of extra fine grit sandpaper and tried sanding the spinach leaves with it. Youre not going to believe this Barbara, but the sand paper did in fact remove the grit on the spinach and it didnt leave any paper problems. The only thing that wasnt quite as good as Id hoped was it smoothed out the spinach leaves so as to make them soggy when my wife cooked them. But my wife, being the industrious gal she is, mixed garlic salt and mayonnaise with the soggy spinach and ended up with a dish of pretty decent spinach flavored guacamole.

Having had to wash 4050lbs of spinach 56 days a week in a busy London restaurant, I can say quite clearly, to get it clean its best to use 2 sinks or 2 large bowls filled with clean cold water.

Then dump the spinach into the second bowl sink and repeat, agitate the spinach well in the water, empty the 1st bowl sink noticing how much dirt was at the bottom, refill with more clean water, lift the spinach from 2nd back to 1st bowl sink and agitate well again. Empty 2nd bowl sink and see if there is less dirt than the first wash? As you are completing the 3rd wash feel at the bottom of the sink bowl for any dirt or traces of dirt, if its dirty, go or a repeat again. Finally when you have thoroughly cleaned the leaves, use your SALAD SPINNER to remove the water, store the leaves in a lidded container in your fridge until ready to cook. What is the best method to clean dirt sand off spinach? Why wouldnt washing and then using a salad spinner multiple times do the trick? What you don't like the grit? Grit is the best part Kidding of course. I actually have never had an issue with grit in my spinach. I don't especially buy it for home. The way to do this and still have nice beautiful fresh looking and unbruised is either with extreme care. Or it won't be possible. Fill a sink with cold water. Dump the spinach in. Swash about. Again if they are for salad then extremely carefully. Then take a spider a scoop either square or round, essentially a strainer on a stick and carefully put them on dry paper towel. I take no responsibility for any culinary casualties. Another option that wouldn't be as thorough would be to toss them loosely in a dry hand towel to encourage any grit to come off. But your best bet is to look for bags marked triple washed and trim. Alternatively if it doesn't matter because it's going on lasagna or a tomato Florentine souo. I would go with frozen. Unless it's the star of course. Don't sub a frozen product for fresh if it is the center focus of the dish. I hope this helps and if you try it and it works let me know.

If youve sprayed a lyebased solvent on the teflon or other nonstick surface, and has started to bubble or otherwise degrade, no you cant use that anymore. I hope it was just the basket that you sprayed if it was a basket style air fryer, and not one of the more expensive ones and you sprayed the entire inside of the unit? It is not safe to use once the nonstick surface has been chemically scored, blistered, or otherwise degraded. Oven cleaners are only to be used on enameled surfaces like the inside of an oven. You should not be using them anywhere else in your kitchen. Youll have to throw it out and get another one. If its just the basket, you may be able to contact the manufacturer directly and have them send you a replacement basket. Can I still use my air fryer?

346,Why are my dish sponges turning black,"I have been using cellulose sponges for many years to wipe off my countertops and one that has a scrubber pad to clean certain pots and pans, and not one has ever turned black. One thing that I do is to always keep them clean and well rinsed out. When I run the dishwasher, I put the sponges on the bottom rack. After almost every use I rinse them very well and squeeze them well. They never even start to stink the way I manage them. Once in awhile I have put a sponge in a plastic bag and in the microwave for a minute on high, and that will remove or kill bacteria, or any other nasties that may start to be growing. If your spawns stinks, has a smell that's bad, you are not managing that sponge properly. I believe that either mold or fungus is growing inside of your sponge because you are not properly keeping it clean, and free from the growth of so many different Critters. Also, if you are wiping really dirty surfaces such as the floor, that will add a lot of filth to the sponge which can cause it to turn color as well. Since you refer to it as a dish sponge, I'm going to assume this is not the case. I believe that you need to ratchet up your sponge maintenance practices. Why are my dish sponges turning black?

The upper wash arm can be blocked by a serving platter that is too tall, or a pot handle or an extra tall serving utensil in the silverware basket. Some dishwashers use a wash tower extending up through the center of the bottom rock to wash the upper rack. A pan or dish blocking the tower may result in the upper rack dishes not being cleaned well. If you are consistently having the problem of sticky or unclean dishes, then make sure you are not committing one of the three  Setting your water heater at 120 degrees may still provide water that is too cool for your dishwasher to do its job. A typical house may have a hot water temperature drop of 10 degrees or more as water flows through the homes plumbing. Use a candy or meat thermometer and measure the temperature of the water coming out of your kitchen faucet. Adjust your water heater so that it is AT LEAST 120 deg F. I have my tank set so water comes out of the faucet about 134 deg F. Dishes get cleaner and so does laundry.

No, you just need to scrape off the bigger crumbs, then just bung it all in I usually let my dogs do a prewash on the plates. If you find that gross, well the dishwasher sterilises everything, so it doesn't matter one bit, so haha. At the bottom of the dishwasher, there is a removable filter. Any unscraped food bits will collect there. That just needs emptying and rinsing now and then. I found that using a quick wash is often not good enough to get everything properly clean, unless it's just a few mucky mugs and glasses. If you've got a casserole dish with food cooked onto it good and proper, you need a longer wash of about 2 hours. As well as emptying the gross bits out of the filter, the dishwasher will wash everything better and last longer if you also use dishwasher salt and rinse aid occasionally, as well as a dishwasher tablet per wash.

In most cases, dishwashers and sinks share a common drain. When a wash cycle ends, a pump pushes water from the dishwasher up and into the sink drain. This can take a variety of paths It can run to a Tee in the drain pipe  ,  It can run into the garbage disposal, if one is present  ,  It can even be run into its own section of drain pipe  ,  In some areas, code requires that an air gap be installed, to separate the two systems  ,  If the water from your dishwasher is entering your sink, it is most likely backing up from the drain. When the dishwasher drains, the water is pumped into the sink drain, and if the drain is backed up, the water will have nowhere to go but back up and into the sink. In that case, the answer is to clear out the drain so the water can flow smoothly. On the other hand, if your area requires an air gap, and the gap is installed backward you might have other issues  ,  If thats the case, reverse the position of the two hoses connected to the gap, under the countertop, and it should correct the problem.

While a sparking microwave is typically safe and the sparking typically has a simple cause, it is a sure sign of a problem that needs to be rectified.

If the plastic has worn off of the metal supports, then the exposed metal will make your microwave spark when you cook food. If you see exposed metal on a rack support, then remove it and replace it with a new one. There is a Piece of Metal Inside the Microwave Any metal that is inside of your microwave will make it spark. Even if you do not see a forgotten spoon or fork on your plate, check for a small piece of aluminum foil or other metal contamination if you see or hear sparking. Remove the metal and the sparking condition will stop. The Waveguide Cover is Soiled Inside your microwave about halfway up one side is a small mesh square.

If you do not feel comfortable making the repair, then you can take your microwave into a local appliance repair shop and they will happily do it for you.

In some places utilities are cheaper during off peak hours, like at night. You may be paying half price for electricity while you are sleeping, so it makes sense to run it at night. Maybe you arent going to be present when the rate change kicks on to start the dishwasher, so there is that delay to help you get there. Maybe you have a hard time falling asleep and if the dishwasher is going when you are trying to sleep you wont be able to, but once you fall asleep its okay, got you there too. Perhaps it makes noise through your wall or floor and the neighbor in the apartment will be bothered by it, or there may be lease conditions of not making noise during certain hours, your life may not line up with those hours all the time so its something you can use to run it during appropriate hours. Cost or noise during specific hours are the reasons why that exists. Whats the point in using the fourhour delay button on a dishwasher? Why are my dish sponges turning black?"

350,What are the dos and don ts for cleaning your car s engine compartment,"If you are talking about an engine from many years ago, without computers, you dont have to worry too much, with spraying the engine. I did it all the time back then and most of the time the inside of the distributor got wet at times and you had to dry it out. They had a do it yourself steam cleaning service that would really clean up an engine and associated parts. But you had to use common sense. Also take off the air cleaner and cover the carb. Then I got a wake up call. Bought a 1972 fuel injected Mercedes 280 SE 4.5 in 1976 and tried the same thing. Once my wife and I were going on a day vacation and I had washed the engine before we left. Going out of town, the car suddenly would only go 50 and bucking like a wild horse. Luck was on my side that day. A shade tree was just ahead and since I had studied up on all the sensors, etc, I simple removed the electronic accelerator enrichment gizmo plug that was attached to the throttle valve body and all was good. This gizmo had sliding contacts that told the brain if the car was at idle or full throttle and also gave the injectors more gas on acceleration. I was lucky as hell that I could disconnect it and the car hardly noticed. Ever since that time, NO WATER. Sometimes I will use a small spray bottle with paint thinner to clean on a cool engine some grease build up. I will wipe up with a cotton rag. I love a nice clean engine but settle for one less than clean and havent had any problems since. This excludes oxygens sensors , etc that just go bad by themselves. Another interesting story. A couple of years ago we spotted a clean 2008 Mercedes at a private party car lot and took it for a ride. The guy selling had some company detail it before hand. On the test ride, pretty soon the car was billowing out smoke from the engine department. We had the salesman with us and immediately pulled over and pulled the hood release. We soon learned the detail company had really spray cleaned the engine dept with water and when we got back from the test ride, there was still evidence of water. Have no idea what they did, but we refused to buy the car, even thou the owner called and said all was good. Most people know water and electricity dont mix and new cars have many sensors and connectors and you are just looking for trouble spraying an engine with high pressure water. What are the dos and donts for cleaning your cars engine compartment? How do I clean the inside of my car engine? What is the most important maintenance to perform on a car besides changing the oil? Can my car last for three months if coolant water leaks into the engine? Is it legal to drink in a car if the car isn't moving engine off? Will the car windows close after the engine stops? A lot of bad information in these responses. Ultimately, your car is constantly fighting a battle of attrition. In that sense, driving it to work is bad As far as whether revving is bad If you're bouncing off the rev limiter, as in, the pedal is flat down and you're relying on the ECU to keep the engine from self destructing, that is bad, if for no other reason than because the ECU does this by cutting fuel, which means the engine spends some amount of time spinning quickly with no fuel to lubricate the top piston ring. Not really a recipe for reliability. But as some of the other answers stated, the engine is designed to run up to the redline. The engine wears faster when it spins faster, but not on some exponential scale. If that were really a problem, the manufacturer has every ability to stop you from doing it. Is revving a car engine bad for the car? If its an old car with a distributor, youll want to avoid a lot of water on the distributor. Its not the end of the world if it gets wet, but water inside it will cause misfires until its dry. So its better to cover the distributor and just clean it by hand afterwards. Apart from that, its pretty much like a modern engine. With modern engines, try not to use high pressure. Sure it might help remove stubborn grime, but the pressure can force water into places that you want to stay dry. As long as there isnt pressure or if you use low pressure, it should be fine apart from the air intake of course. No matter how new or old the car, dont spray water into the air intake. Cover the air intake if needed, and clean the covered part by hand later. The alternator can get wet, just dont blast it with pressure. The same goes for electronic connectors. If possible, try not to get water into the spark plug wells. If it does pool in there, youll have to extract the water somehow shop vac, paper towels, whatever you have before trying to start the car. You can wash the engine cold or lukewarm, but dont wash a hot engine. The thermal shock of all that cold water can damage components. Dont let the degreaser dry, it will leave stains even water based degreaser stains. Old toothbrushes are very handy for scrubbing tight spaces. If the battery is in the engine bay, dont blast it with a lot of water. When youre done cleaning the engine bay, you can apply a dressing to the plastic. You can also use the wax of your choice or even a ceramic coating if youre like me on the engine bay paint to make it look even nicer, and make it easier to keep clean. You can also take a Dremel and wire brushes, as well as an old rag and metal polish to get some shine out of the various aluminium parts. Just mind the little wires if you use a Dremel, they like to fly everywhere, getting in your clothes and definitely wear eye protection, you dont want those little brass wires in your eyes. And remember, its a lot easier to keep the engine bay clean than to clean one thats been left too long. The engine bay in my Z3 just gets a regular wipe with a damp microfibre, and then a dressing when needed. My Mazda 323 which is my daily driver despite being 34 years old now gets dirty a lot faster though due to how open everything is and there are a few leaks that Im struggling with despite having rebuilt the whole engine, so it needs a more thorough cleaning on a regular basis to keep the dirt from sticking. In case you wonder about the certificate in the photo, topless in this case is convertible slang for the roof being down.  ,   ,   ,  What are the dos and donts for cleaning your cars engine compartment? Dont saturate the alternator, you can wet it but it doesnt really pay to try filling it with water or chemical cleaning agents The same holds true if you have a distributor, saturating that will result in a misfire and only thorough drying will stop it  on the inside especially Coil on plug arrangement dont go filling the plug hole up with liquid or the cable joiners too  for the same reason. I find it easier to use a compressed air gun to disperse the water after giving it a good going over. I first apply a degreaser and wait 30 minutes or scrub what I can with an old scrubbing brush and apply a little more degreaser if it completely dries out before water blasting it. Also keep the water out of the carburettor or air filter inlet a soggy air filter chokes the engine. Water and petrol dont really mix well. But you can spray if you dont go too crazy getting every piece of dirt or grime off the carburettor. Injectors starter motors power steering pumps dont seem to mind a good water blasting. Dont go blasting the Brake and or clutch master cylinder too much either as you can at times blow the top of . Brake fluid and water do mix but with tragic results as when the water expands it turns into steam and steam is compressible, unlike brake fluid . You may not have any brakes at some time after the event when the fluid is nice and hot. Also if you do spray the wheels and brake calipers or drum brakes maybe ride the brake a little for your first journey after the wash as water can reduce the effectiveness of the brake until it is cooked off by using the brake.

The term CC represents the unit Cubic Centimeter of Volume. And in case of Engines it is used to represent the Volume of the Internal Combustion Engine Cylinders. The CC can also be represented in Liters, as shown below 1000cc  1000 cm  1 Liter  1.0L. The above section is the answer in case you are technically aware of what is an Engine Cylinder. If not, please read on. There are many types of Engines used for myriad applications in todays world. The most common are the Automotive  Marine Internal Combustion Engines which operate on Fossil Fuels mostly. In these Engines the fuel is burnt in a controlled explosion to generate Mechanical Energy. The controlled explosion happens inside a cavity within the Engine called an  Within, these  For easier understanding of the piston movement just imagine the movement of the plunger piston inside a Medical Syringe for an Injection.  ,  Every up  down stroke of an  Hence, the CC i.e Cubic Centimeters is the quantity of the Total Swept Volume of any Engine. Total Swept Volume, CC  No of Cylinders X Swept Volume of One Cylinder, cc. Now, the importance of this CC is that it represents the Capacity of the Engine. As CC is nothing but the amount of Fuel i.e AirFossil Fuel that can be compressed in one stroke of the piston. More the amount of Fuel that can be compressed, more the power that the Engine can generate.  ,  P.S  Sorry for the long post.

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.  ,  Development of Your Thesis A thesis is the essence of your paperthe claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement. Strong Form A good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement. Style Just as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genrespecific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice. Conventions Conventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spellchecking tools such as  Support and References Finally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism.

Learning to master these five elements will cause your scores to soar What are the best tips for essay writing? I assume you mean cleaning the engine and the engine compartment here. Usually the underside of the hood is covered with insulation so it does not qualify for cleaning. So, the engine. Dirt and grime can cause long term problems with some of the more sensitive parts of the engine and control system so removing it is a way to improve engine performance and prevent the problems related to contamination like rust and electrical shorts. That being said, cleaning the engine bay should be done with care and you should not just blast it with water. You will want to use a degreasing type soap to remove the crud while making sure that it does not pool on electrical boxes or in the engine air intake. Once the crud is loosened a gentle flush with clean water will generally suffice. Be sure, again to not pool water on the electronics or in the air intake. When you finish the rinse it is a good idea  although not essential  to blow any standing water off of the engine and control devices just to be sure that there is no contamination. Always do the engine cleaning first or you are going to be recleaning the fenders and windshield and maybe the roof again. Does cleaning the underneath the hood of my car protects my engine? Question  I will list the dos, the donts will take care of themselves. Wash the engine when it is cooled off and use an electric pressure washer, they are not that powerful, and they use cold water. Modern engines are pretty much protected from the elements but dont spray a lot on electrical boxes, etc. If there is builtup grease, use an engine degreaser and a scrub brush on those areas. It is pretty easy to go from dirty to clean using that process. This was mostly dried dirt on a car I bought. All it took was the pressure washer, no soap even.The headlights were dull also, I used a 3M kit on those.  ,   ,  My Photos. What are the dos and donts for cleaning your cars engine compartment? I dont think you can? I bought a one owner Dodge from a farmer. He had changed the oil every 2,000 miles, yet it developed a rod knock, and I never took it over 70. When I tore the engine down, I filled a 2 gal. pail with sludge I scraped out of it. Took the block to the machine shop and had it rebuilt. There was no way to clean all that out without destroying the engine. Ive run several engines over 100k miles, and the inside was still Showroom new, using Mobil since 1966. Ive seen dyno results of 10 power increases more than once, just by changine to Mobil1. You can look thru the oil filler cap on my 2002 Cadillac DTS, and it looks Just like new. When I built the engine in our 1964 Triumph Spitfire I used Mahl pistons and Dykes rings. Ran Mobil1. When we beat the National Champ from CA, he protested. Threw a fit when the SCCA inspectors declared our engine Legal I pulled some machining tricks, but Mobil1 got much of the credit why we could pull away from him. Ill never forget him saying, Ive got a 15,000 blueprinted, dyno tuned engine, his cant be Legal Car owner bought dinner and drinks, and we had lots of laughs How do I clean the inside of my car engine? Do it Don't be scared Don't use pressure washer These are the main dos and don'ts. Use common sense and good quality degreaser. What I do is I spray it with degreaser from a spray bottle. Go over the surfaces and agitate it with a brush. Let it sit for a little bit and then rinse it off with a hose. Then I dress the plastic bits, trying to avoid dressing any belts. Wipe it dry, that's it. Everything under the hood is waterproof. So long you don't use a pressure washer you spritz water anywhere. Cars and Automobile What are the dos and donts for cleaning your cars engine compartment? Yes. IF you cover the alternator and battery. You dont want those wet. Not a bad idea to cover various electrical connectors as well, but this isnt mandatory. Theyre pretty water resistant already. Id only use a garden hose, as pressure can force water where you dont want it, like those waterresistant connectors I mentioned. A good degreaser and a bristle brush or two will loosen all the gunk, then apply garden hose to rinse. Repeat as necessary. Spend a few minutes waterproofing your electronics, take your time, and youll be fine. There are videos all over YouTube as well, if youd like to watch before you try Is it safe to wash a car engine with water? How can I wash my car engine without damaging it? Engines are designed to be relatively water resistant, or else driving on a rainy day would cause you some real problems That being said,  Do not use a pressure washer to clean an engine. The hard parts will handle that all right, but the numerous soft parts, including wires and sensors, may not Rain water is not under high pressure, and while the various connections under the hood are meant to keep out rain water that may splash up under the hood, theyre not necessarily designed to keep high velocity streams of water aimed at them out. Id let the engine dry for a bit with the hood open before driving the car, if possible. If you have a cracked ignition coil or the like, you may have some issues if you need to go somewhere right after washing your engine. Do mind washing grease and oil off of your engine.

356,Could I charge 15 an hour for being a private cleaner or is this too much I have 5 years of experience and have a DBS check,"in the USA, that's about 18 an hour which is competitive. but, remember the pandemic. a lot of people don't want strangers in their homes .you would be better of trying for lite commercial accounts .you might have to work when they are closed .the upside is generally you can charge a bit more. good luck.. hope you get rich..lol Could I charge 15 an hour for being a private cleaner or is this too much? I have 5 years of experience and have a DBS check. Is it true that locum doctors get paid just about 100 per hour? My plumber charges 200 for just a twentyminute job. Every time I get a deep cleaning at my dentist office they Always push I also get Arestin antibiotic. It is so expensive like 284 and insurance does not cover it. Is this necessary? Am I being up charged for something I do not need? Do dentists charge too much? How can someone be sure they wont be taken advantage of when visiting the dentist for consultation, Xray and cleaning? How much do Molly Maids make per hour? Why don't they clean houses independently? Being the owner of a maid service, my opinion is quite high so here is a different perspective for you. Be clear on your expectations and prepared to pay for them. A written and signed contract is always best. Make sure you know what they can and cannot do. Many cleaning crews are not window washers for instance and yes they do know how much a window washing company charges. It's shocking. Hold the crew accountable for their work and be accountable for compensating it. If you are not happy, tell them and give them a chance to fix it. Refusing to pay them without giving them a chance to correct whatever human error they made is unreasonable. Even the best crews make mistakes but they will always fix it. Cleaning is hard physical work and that crew has probably done multiple jobs before you and still have more after. Don't expect an entire redo or freebie for a hay needle miss. Keep chitchat to a minimum as the crew is most likely on a tight time schedule. ie leave them alone and let them get their work done. In short, be fair and don't take advantage of them. They want you to be happy. Return the courtesy. Don't treat them like uneducated servents. If a paid cleaning crew is relieving your stress, then it's worth paying for, but remember that it is a luxury purchase not everyone can afford. What is your opinion of paid cleaning crews? Cleaning and disinfecting are two different processes. Cleaning means physically removing germs, dirt and organic matter from surfaces. Disinfecting means using chemicals to kill germs on surfaces. Its important to clean before disinfecting because organic matter and dirt can reduce the ability of disinfectants to kill germs. A combination of cleaning and disinfection will be most effective in removing the COVID19 virus. Cleaning reduces the soil load on the surface, allowing the disinfectant to work and kill the COVID19 virus. Disinfectant may not kill the virus if the surface has not been cleaned with a detergent first. Workplaces should clean surfaces at least daily. Special attention should be given to frequently touched surfaces like tabletops, door handles, light switches, desks, toilets, taps, TV remotes, kitchen surfaces and cupboard handles. Ideally, once clean, surfaces should also be disinfected regularly. Alternatively, you may be able to do a 2in1 clean and disinfection by using a combined detergent and disinfectant. For routine cleaning, disinfectants are usually only necessary if a surface has been contaminated with potentially infectious material. For this reason, when and how often a workplace should undertake disinfection as part of routine cleaning will depend on the likelihood of contaminated material being present at the workplace. For example, in a busy retail environment with many customers and others entering a workplace each day, more frequent disinfection is recommended to prevent the spread of COVID19. By contrast, for a small work crew operating the same item of plant each day with little interaction with other people, routine disinfection in addition to daily  Wear gloves when cleaning. Gloves should be discarded after each clean. If it is necessary to use reusable gloves, gloves should only be used for COVID19 related cleaning and should not be used for other purposes or shared between workers. What is the normal rate for a COVID 19 cleaning? Overhead is relatively low so pricing is largely based on labor costs. Now, there are several basic types of cleaning services out there. Some companies operate on a independent contractor basis which means that the actual cleaner who shows up to do the work may or may not be able to give you the best cleaning for the higher than some price you'll pay. Some companies give the independent contractor employees decent training but it's more likely they only give dos and donts training because the pay is based on an hourly pay but the company is not making a cut of the job if the employee is not actually cleaning a house. The independent contractor status is mostly beneficial to the company and not the employees so quality of service varies widely depending on skill, experience, work ethics and stamina of the person or perhaps 2 person team who shows up and cleans. Other companies who do not hire people as independent contractors are more consistent with the quality of service because the company does a bit more training. It's also likely that a lead member on the team who comes to clean is responsible for both quality control and guidance for the group. Consistent quality but probably not exceptional and be prepared for 3 to 5 person teams with a lot of changes to the persons who will show up every cleaning. These companies tend to charge at the highest end of the spectrum because they offer fair pay compared to independent contractor companies, they train new employees and they also have higher overhead in providing a company vehicle, cleaning equipment and supplies, as well as some of them offering employee benefits. Both of the above described types of cleaning companies do have some type of a guarantee insurance bond in case of subpar cleaning, negligence, damage or theft. This is figured into the price and obviously the better the guarantee offered for those things, the higher the cost to the customer. The other most common type of cleaning company is the little guy which varies from completely under the radar cash for cleaning individuals to a small business that is licensed and operating legitimately as such. The cost of services in this group can vary greatly but will be less than the cost of one of the big guys because there are lots of fingers in the big guys pies I personally operate as a legitimate small business that provides residential cleaning services. I'm not charging minimum wage prices but I'm also well below the cost of the big guys. I might have reason to be biased as my opinion comes from the position of being a small business owner but the little guys who keep it legit such as having a business license and a clear price structure based on the exact services that will be performed will usually keep their cleaning services personal, meaning quality control is the best it gets in the business. The method I used when I first started out, and worked by myself, for determining what to charge is that I took minimum wage and added 5 an hour to it. I provided all necessary supplies to do the job and got myself there so that 5 an hour over minimum wage was to cover those costs and because I felt I worked harder than minimum wage and cared more than minimum wage. Fast forward 18 years to now and I have changed my pricing structure but not by as much as you might think Now I have employees so obviously I need to charge per hour at least what they are paid and it's higher than minimum wage to start plus raises regularly based on performance and dedication longevityper hour plus my minimum wage plus now 7 an hour for myself but I now also include a 25 per job fee that goes directly to me because I provide exceptional service in every way and I do so every house, every time I have 18 years experience and I am better at my job than ever before and my company name remains unblemished because of the great care and pride I take in providing excellent cleaning and customer service. I don't give that pricing breakdown when quoting or billing for my services but that is my method for determining it. I keep up with what other companies are charging, both big and small, so I can tell you that my pricing remains lower, usually significantly so, than the big guys and higher than the non licensed individuals who often charge little more than minimum wage. One final note on how I determine what to charge. I sometimes have a customer that is unable to do the necessary basic cleaning upkeep in their home because of physical limitations and at the same time, they struggle with affording my services, especially on a routine schedule, let alone the prices of a bigger company. Although I have no official policy or fee schedule that applies in this scenario, I do offer those in obvious need a lower price for scheduling my services on a routine basis and not just once or occasionally. That price is based on my employees hourly pay x 2. That's it. We both make a bit more than minimum wage and the customer can live in a house that is at least clean enough to no longer be sub standard living conditions and often it's cleaner than they ever had hope of living in I am not a doctor who does miracles of healing or a lawyer who saves people from financial ruin, prison sentences or their vengeful exes and I do clean toilets to provide a roof and life's basics BUT I can do one thing exceptionally well, I can clean, even the most hopeless of messes. So I think that sometimes my talent for cleaning should be used for good without much concern for profit. Happy cleaning How do cleaning companies come up with their pricing?

Not cleaning exactly, but working in bedrooms Ive seen a lot of strange stuff. I work in apartment maintenance so Ive been in thousands of bedrooms over the years, over and over again. Instead of thinking back through the years Ill tell you about something that happened just today, just before quitting time. I always go in to check work orders about 30 minutes before quitting time to make sure nothing important came in. I saw one of my favorite residents in the lobby. I hadnt seen her in a while and asked how shes been and if everything was OK in her apartment. She said she was opening a drawer and the front came off. I said, Lets go see it now in case it needs to be clamped or glued or whatever. I picked up her bags since she had just come in from shopping and we walked to the elevator together. Once I got to her place, I started looking at her kitchen cabinets and everything looked fine. I asked her which bathroom had the problem and she told me they were fine, it was her bedside dresser. I didnt think much of it, I dont have any problem doing stuff to help the people who live here. They pay a lot of money, and to my way of thinking they pay my salary so I asked her to show me which one. We go in her bedroom and she wanted me to look at two more things. First, a rug hers that keeps bunching and shifting. I reminded her that I told her over and over if she gets the grippy backing Id put it down and it wouldnt keep happening. The other was he bed keeps moving. She has one of those adjustable beds that rise up and down and recede and such. Ive told her more than once if she lets a pillow fall behind it it will push it away from the wall and shift the bed. But she is a stubborn woman who wants to keep doing the same stuff again and again and expects different results. So this time I said something different. What are you doing to make your bed move so much? She looks at me and starts laughing. Tells me she is too old for a boyfriend and what she does in bed is none of my business anyway. I agree its not my business but shes making it my problem so she has to slow her roll. She calls me a smart ass and asks me if the drawer can be fixed. The front is on the floor and I pull the drawer out. A cheap little thing like you would get from Mayfair or Target. Just held on by dowels and cam locks. Nothing is broken so I told her no problem. I ask her if I can dump the contents on her bed. She looks unsure and uncomfortable so I do it anyway. Under her socks is a big ass, old school, industrial Hitachi Magic Wand. I said thats the problem right there. She asked how could that have broken her drawer. I said it didnt but its messing her bed up 0 When cleaning up a bedroom, have you ever found something you weren't supposed to see? How can I clean your oven without any harsh chemicals?"

Brake rotors usually only need to be cleaned during installation to remove any grease, oil or oily residue that may be present on them during manufacturing and or shipping or from the mechanics hands. One of the better methods of accomplishing this if not wearing mechanics gloves is to spray the rotors themselves with brake cleaner, then wiping them dry with a lint gritfree towel OR spraying the lint gritfree towel liberally with brake cleaner and wiping both surfaces of each new brake rotor, then allowing the rotor to dry.

379,Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy,"Because shes obviously traditional and probably expects her daughters to marry, have kids and be the stay at home mom. Honestly this isnt advice right here but this is what I would do, refuse to do chores until she gives the brother even work, and if chores are for girls the mom should be doing them too. This is a great way to get yourself grounded but if all 4 join in the house will be a mess and the mom will have to do all the work or give chores to the son as well. Unfortunately theres nothing anyone can do legally because its not abuse and she just has a different view point of parenting. But this is advice right here if your one of the daughters or are in the same boat, remember how you feel now and make sure if when you have your own kids remember how giving chores to only the girls made you feel terrible and dont do it with your own kids and split them evenly. Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. What kind of chores do you require your child to do? How should a dad deal with his teenage daughter being disobedient and refusing to do her chores after he grounds her for talking back to both him and her mother? How do mothers treat sons and daughters differently? How often do you help your mom in household chores? Why dont some mothers like their son do the household chores even though they would like some help themselves from their husbands? In a word Different. We have three children, a son that is 19, our daughter is 14 and then a son again that is now 10. As a mother I have found sons easier, but maybe unconsciously, my expectations and concerns are different. My sons are slowly growing into men and they want to please me and in most ways the relationship is not adversarial, they do not see themselves as a reflection of me but instead I am a support, helper and sometimes buddy. My daughter likely sees herself though some reflection of how I am as a wife, mother and women. Some of it she strives for and some of it likely bothers her and she wants to strike out on a different path. So at times she can be challenging, secretive and disappointed in me. I probable was the same with my mother. However, she also knows that I will keep her secrets better than her friends, not judge her, and I think she is the most beautiful and amazing girl and love her unconditionally. That creates a push pull relationship. My job is to raise a women and I only know how to do that based on my own experiences so of course we butt heads at times when I challenge her choices or actions. Sometimes its also my fault as I want her not to make my mistakes and be better than menormal but probable unreasonable and unfair. I also know that she has an easier relationship with her father as she sees in his eyes she is a princess of sorts, and that can be wonderful for the ego of a 14 year old girl women. He finds his relationship with our sons harder, likely for all the same reasons my relationship with my daughter can be challenging to me. In time I know she will try to find her own path in life and like most women, and likely, she will be surprised to find herself walking in a path more similar to her mother than she expected and hear herself saying my words coming out of her mouth as she speaks to her children. If my sons marry they will find themselves entangled in their spouse and children, inlaws and mortgage payments. That is when we are blessed, as daughters often return to their parents as friends, remembering birthdays and call just to say hello and chat. I think its different raising a daughter than a son, but if done with care, I think the rewards last a lifetime. What is it like to have a daughter vs a son?

Add the worlds best search experience to your website   ,  Sources https  www.forrester.com report GoogleizeYourSiteSearchExperience  ERES124541 https  www.yext.com resources publications nowronganswers https  www.yext.com products answers Why is search mission critical for brands? I have one of each. I can relate my experience. My first child is a girl. I talked to her constantly, from even before she was born. I played games with her, grabbing her heel through my belly and I swear she reciprocated by kicking back When she was handed to me as a newborn, I was terrified that I was responsible for this perfect little human being. She looked even more terrified as she made eye contact We bonded immediately. As my daughter grew, she followed me everywhere and talked nonstop. I lovingly wrote down all her milestones. She loved sitting on my lap and reading. Talking or listening. Playing quietly. Helping me in the kitchen. She is 13 now, and things have changed quite a bit, but thats a different story. My second child, a boy, was quite different. I had minor complications after his birth. I never really bonded with him until he was diagnosed with neonatal jaundice and had to spend a couple of nights at the hospital. I dont believe he ever really bonded with me. His sister was his world His face lit up when she walked into the room, he followed her everywhere with his eyes before he could crawl and thereafter walked, and ran behind her. As my son grew, the only time he would want to come to me was if he was sick or hurt. Other times, he was busy running around, taking things apart, jumping off of furniture just being rough and rowdy I was eternally afraid of him hurting himself and ending up in the ER, which we did only a couple of times. He is 10 now, and if I walk with him into the trail, he will actually talk to me, though it is about video games and nerf guns. I love my daughter and my son, and I know they both love me. However, how we express and experience love is very different. Is having a son different for a mother than having a daughter? Possibly, at first. Little girls are the shining ray of sunlight in their daddys eyes, while boys are the first to go running to mom. Girls go to dad because he is strong and can fix anything oh, and, dads will give her everything she wants with just the batting of her eyes. Boys go to mom because she wont look down at him if he shows weakness, plus, with their innocent act, they can talk mom into anything. As they age, this dynamic changes. Dads become totally baffled by the missing little girl when she starts menstruating and her female thinking changes. She needs her freedom, and doesnt want dad to look at her as a little girl any more. She starts to pay more attention to her mom, because mom is a woman, and the daughter is becoming more like her. Moms start being totally confused about where the little boy went when his voice changed and muscles started bulking out. Suddenly, she is no longer needed as a fail safe when he is hurting. Now, he goes to dad to get instruction on how men do things. Love objects, though, tend to be the same as before. Daughters pick boyfriends that are similar to their fathers, while sons often look for a girlfriend that is a lot like their mother. I dont think it is a conscious act on their part. It just happens. Once they are fullfledged adults and out on their own, the dynamic may change again, to the point that either parent is seen as an equal. Theres no really easy answer to the question of daughter father or son mother. Nothing is really written in stone when it comes to people. Why is the father more attached to his daughter and the mother to her son? Is it true that mothers love their sons more than their daughters, and fathers love their daughters more than their sons? Why is the father more attached to his daughter and the mother to her son? Why do parents not make their kids do chores? Could a mother become partial to a daughter while having more than one daughters? Why do my daughters hit my son so much? Is it ok for my mom to keep my stuff unless I do chores? Yes I have this one summer day my son with playing with a neighbor boy when he was about 12. Things got very quiet in the bedroom and that always meant something was up I was curious what they were up to so I crept towards his bedroom. The door was just ajar a tiny crack but enough for me to see what they were up to. His buddy was a couple years younger and they were both naked. Oh my gawd they were playing doctor and I couldnt help but stand there and watch. It was mesmerizing watching the whole thing unfold. This is something a grown up rarely sees and if they do they usually break things up. But this was something else my knees just locked in place and I just froze and watched. Making a long story short, they were touching each other and both were very erect, then my son talked his buddy into letting him put his thingy into his buddies mouth. I was totally frozen seeing this very taboo but also very erotic activity unfold. Then after some mutual play this led to my son going down on his buddy. WOW, this was amazing to see. There was more going on but Ill leave it at that. Im sure they carried on all through the summer and I gave them space. My son grew up just fine, now hes married, kids and all the rest. Have you ever caught your son daughter doing something inappropriate with another boy girl? I happen to be partial to Galvanize, but wholly concur with Robertos advice. nBoth Metis and Galvanize run highly respected programs and it really comes down to what is right for you. Here are  1. Who else is the program admitting? A welldesigned program will require an application, skill evaluation and interviews, to ensure that every student is set up to succeed in the program. If a bootcamp is ready to take your credit card number without any questions upfront, theyre more interested in their bottom line than in your education. 2. How do they calculate their placement numbers? Sure, 99 placements rate sounds good, but whats really behind that number? Skyhigh placement percentages can be meaningless, depending on how theyre calculated. Theres no standard industry definition of employed  does it include graduates who got a job unrelated to their new field? Lessthanideal freelance and parttime gigs? Dig into the data. After all, youre on your way to becoming a data scientist 3. How long does the program last? Start a new career in tech in six weeks Sounds too good to be true, and thats probably because it is. Coding,  4. Outside of class, what does this program offer? Will your bootcamp send you off with nothing more than a certificate and a pat on the back? The right program doesnt just offer training, it provides the connections for you to break into your new field. Whether its hiring events, access to a network of industry heavyhitters or ongoing assistance with your resume, applications and interviews, the best bootcamps offer a range of resources to get you hired. Beyond career services, what does your campus offer? Will you be stuck in a windowless cube all day, or surrounded by people eager to innovate and collaborate? While some bootcamps cultivate a community of likeminded learners, other leave you adrift on your own. Try to get a sense of the daytoday before you commit to spending six months on campus  its worth the research. I am deciding between attending the Galvanize Data Science bootcamp and the Metis Data Science bootcamp. Which should I choose? Because she's old fashioned. Or because she is jealous of the daughter and is keeping her down. Or because she is gaining favour of the son. or . . Because the daughter shallows it and doesn't leave some of the work for the brother. There is certainly the case where female is married with children and does the housework while the father earns money. But how is this connected to the daughter doing it all? If its meant to be training. If there were 3 daughters who divided the work, would that then mean they would only be a third as competent housekeepers? No, housework isn't rocket science. So doing less woukd still train the girl. Maybe explain to her that some women work and hire a housekeeper. A Male, if they so choose. I say go on strike and get him off his chair What does he do, sit with his feet up like some little rajah while you work? Yeah right. Tell uour mum you intend to be successful, but not to worry, if your brother is not, because he never learned a work ethic at home, or how to pull his weight, you'll hire him as your housekeeper Why would a mom make her teen daughter do chores like clean the dishes, house, car and do laundry and do other chores but the mom never makes older son do any chores because he is a boy? Why would the mom tell her daughter chores is for girls? It does not happen often as you decipher.I am from Nigeria where sons are rated higher over daughters.We are five in our family and I am the last born. I have two set of twin sisters and I happen to be the last born and only boy.I.e baby of the  Thus,a real Mum never pamper the son at all or else she will die regrettably at the end Enjoy Why do mothers pamper their sons but discipline their daughters? And this as a result makes the son arrogant in the sense that he can get away with anything and sometimes even demean the mother. Why does this happen often? This is how that mother was raised and how she believes things should be done. Try not to judge her TOO harshly for running her house the same way she was raised. Some other people who have answered, assumed you are one of the daughters, but your question doesn't say that is the case. If not, then this is quite literally  If yes you are one of the daughters, then you and the other daughters can sit down with mom and try and negotiate for a somewhat more equitable arrangement. But remember you are the children and she is the PARENT. You dont have a whole lot of negotiation power. If you all vote on something and each kid gets one vote, then the parents each get 10 votes. DO NOT pull that go on strike Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. Sexism. Lifelong programming. How it was done so she will continue to do it. In the same way that girls in Middle Eastern countries, as well as in other developing countries, are required to quit school and find work to pay for their brothers to continue with his education at least with families that are living in poverty. There has long been an idea that women are less than  less important, less smart, less capable  and that womens main purpose is to nurture and support. As a young girl in the 2000s, I also experienced this. I knew how unfair it was, but in my family, that's how it was done. Those girls will likely resent their mother or carry on this repressive tradition. Not only does it tell them it is their job as girls women to clean and take care of everyone, but it also tells the boy that he doesnt have to clean after himself and should expect any woman in life to clean up after him  take care of him. Its sad and destructive for all. Parenting Kids Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. Yeah, I had an aunt like this. Her elder daughter was an alcoholic by the time she was 16. She died in her early 40s drunk and frozen to death. Her younger daughter left home at 18, married, had 2 children, and was killed by a drunk driver at the age of 25. Her older son is fairly normal with the exception of his idolization of Trump. Her younger son at the age of 64 still think he's the baby of the family and everything revolves around him. My aunt pretty much ruined her entire family by treating her daughters like housekeepers and her sons like God. Great parenting. Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. No Mom is wrong as her son after marriage has to do all the household chores. He has to cook, clean, do laundry, take care of children and when wife comes home from work he has to prepare tea for her and hotwater for her to take bath. Now, dear sisters please don't blame your mother when your brother does all those things for his wife. Lady, the quality of a woman is that she can do all these things and still work and earn money. They are master multitaskers. Have you observed your mother cooking, watching TV, talking on phone and serving tea to your Dad at the same time. Now if the son or the father is to do all of these, they would have burnt the food, hardly even look at something called TV, spilled the tea and put the other person on the phone on hold. Ladies you are blessed. You are the envy of all men at home when it comes to chores. Guys tend to loose it at the first instance. Hence, your awesome old lady is brilliant who has the wholesome understanding of this basics without reading John Gray's book  Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus'. Awesome she is. Isn't she? Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. My exmotherinlaw was like this. She was firmly stuck in stereotypes of what was womens work and what was mens work. Therefore, growing up her son did no housework at all he did manage to learn how when he moved out, and her daughters who never moved out and STILL live at home at ages 56 and 60 are completely helpless when it comes to yard work or car maintenance. She did none of them any favors. All of the kids are codependent as hell and unable to maintain a relationship. Times have changed  in America at least. Both genders need to have basic skills that cross traditional roles. No one wants to get involved with a capable person who acts helpless and who cannot be a partner in life. Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. well marissa for one you dont say ages so i will assume the boy is young and all 4 girls are the older ones. So the boy is not at an age to be able to use the mower or a whipper snipper to work in the yard but the boy should clean his room atleast. Do you only do stuff inside the house or do you use the mower and whipper snipper in the yard as well take the bin out weed the garden. your mother is doing the right thing so when you become that mother you can look after your kids and you will know what to do plus she may believe you do a better job than the boy anyway so get back to cleaning those dishes sweeping and mopping the floor cleaning the bathroom and toilet Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. When I had my son many decades ago, he was such a great baby, slept through the first night he was home, was a sunny and goodnatured little guy, cried very seldom and when a toddler, played with his toys all afternoon happy as a lark. Because of his demeanour, I wanted another boy. My second child was a girl, who kept me up for a few nights but then slept well after. They were both large babies 10 and 11 lbs. so I think they were better developed and therefore didnt fuss much. Each child has a different character, have their own uniqueness and personality, They are now both welladjusted and caring people with their own children. It really does not matter which gender they are as long as they are happy and healthy. Do you prefer having a son or a daughter? Would you rather have daughters or sons? Apart from the ridiculous inequality, she is doing her son no favours. When he leaves home he will struggle to look after himself and have to learn how to do all those chores from scratch. If he had shared them with his sisters, it would have been less work for all of them and he would be aware of what was required. We had five kids, three daughters, two sons. All were treated equally, all were expected to do some household chores  not a lot but enough to teach them what is necessary. They left home as capable adults and didnt ever expect their partners to do their chores, nor bear the burden of it all but expected their partners to pitch in as well. The girls should go on strike until he does his share. Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. I do sort of. I have 2 younger brothers, and Im the only girl. My 9 year old brother does tons of sports, boxing, soccer, baseball, football, etc. He always tells me he wants to be like dad, but not the bad side of him. He acts like my dad too. Getting angry only after he bottles up emotion too long. Very quiet but loud with people hes comfortable with. Good at video games. They also share looks They have moles in the same places too lol. Me, a 13 year old girl, Im more like my mom. Im a lot taller than her, but I really resemble her. She likes to cook, I like to cook. We share similiar likings. Im her favorite cause I put up with her, as she said. My other brother is nothing like the two of them, hes just a little ball of anger issues and a video game addict. Hes 5 tho, so well just wait a see i guess .  Do you believe like father like son like mother like daughter? Why or why not? I am unmarried anyhow I would like to answer it.. In my cite there shouldn't be any discrimination between son and a daughter.. Irrespective of gender.. Kids are always kids.. No parent thinks that Its a baby girl I'll love her more Or it's a baby Boy I will love him less.. Sons and daughters are equally liked.. Bringing a child to the world with a premature judgement that a daughter is better than a son or it's opposite, you are bound to failure.. If gender equality is nurtured at the home itself then there wouldn't be any difference between a son and a daughter.. A son as well as a daughter Love you even more when you love them unconditionally.. At the right time both son and daughter take up there responsibility and make you proud.. So love your kids irrespective of whether it's a son or a daughter.. Who do you like the most your son or your daughter? Whom do you like more, your daughter or your son? This is in the least bit surprising. You see, in history for thousands of years, the society has preferred guys over girls. I can totally relate to this type of situation. My fathers mother, or my grand mother, has four daughters. In fact, her first four kids were daughters. But she kept trying over and over until she got a boy. Its just an unfortunate stereotype of the society, where girls deserve to do the crappy work. The mother might just have been taught this from her mother. Sexism is both a choice and a desicion made from outside influence. If your parents are like this, the BEST BEST thing to do is to talk to them about it. Hope this helps  Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all. She's got archaic ideas and obviously wants to keep her son a child as long as possible. She's seriously harming his ability to function as an adult once he leaves home. I consider this slightly abusive as she is handicapping him before he even becomes an adult. What's he going to do when he moves out? Call mommy to fix his dinner and do his laundry? No woman wants a manchild like that or to have to take care of him like a child. She's seriously misguided. Why would a mom make her 4 daughters do chores but not her son? The mom told her daughters chores are for girls and not boys. The 4 daughters have to clean the whole house and do laundry and other stuff while the boy doesn't do any work at all.

After I housed a troupe of then untouchable feral kittens I bought a bag of diatomaceous earth and sprinkled it in the carpet. Not super heavily. I left it in for about a week or two, then vacuumed. I sprinkle it on cat trees also, leave for a few days, then vacuum off. It is a dust that microscopically has spiky edges. The spikes poke holes in the shells of fleas all insects and they then die of dehydration in around a day or less. Diatomaceous earth is nontoxic, but as a dust it is an irritant to eyes and lungs. why I eventually vacuum it back up. Other than that it is very safe. If you pour a ton on and it gets wet then it becomes a goopy mess, so you dont need to cake it on. I wouldnt vacuum it up in that state unless you have either a shop vac or a vacuum with bags you can replace. I like it because it is completely effective, and environmentally friendly. It doesnt take a week to work it just takes between 612 hours after the insect walks through it temperature and humidity controlled Im sure. A week or longer just ensures all the little buggers crawl through it. Its great for under furniture and places you cant vacuum often. In those areas I sprinkle it and just leave it.

I use the same one for days at a time by steaming it after every use I put it in a vegetable steamer Bring the water to a full rolling boil, then I take it off the heat and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes. I hang it by one of the straps on a coat hanger to dry Steam kills EVERYTHING Been doing this since March and I think its a great idea On a side note, your last name is the same as my mother's maiden name Where do you live? My relatives lived in New Kensington PA. then moved to Ohio. So without giving away any really personal information, can you tell me what state your family lives in? Many thanks Are disposable paper masks more itchy than cloth masks? Why are cloth face masks the smart option? Which is the most comfortable mask to wear? How can I make a face mask to protect against COVID19, using only common items materials at home? What do they make mask out of? What is the best safe mask? What you call a paper What happens if you don't is that the mask keeps collecting pathogens, ones picked up from the environment but most importantly ones we all breathe out. After 8 hours of use such a mask becomes basically a petri dish where harmful bacteria start to happily breed, ready to cause all sorts of disease in the wearer. And anyone who lives with him or her. A good cloth mask can and should be washed each and every day. Washing it with hot water and fabric detergent and occasionally disinfecting it with bleach or alcohol keeps your mask in prime condition and always hygienic to wear. For the health of your husband and yourself. Is a cloth mask better than a paper mask? My husband has been using the same paper mask for months. There is a major difference between a cloth mask and a paper mask or what some people would call paper. Cloth masks may be ok if you want to protect someone else from getting infected by you if you cough or sneeze but it does little if anything to protect you from the virus. There is only two semi different masks that will protect you from the virus and I say semi different because of how they are worn. The N95 masks are made to filter out 95 percent or more of the virus particulates and they use head wraps to attach to your face. They are the same masks that doctors and health care professionals use to protect themselves from the virus but they aren't easy to get and they can be a little pricey. The other alternative is the KN95 masks which are the Chinese equivalent to the N95 masks but for all intent and purposes are basically the same thing except for they attach to your face with ear loops. Right now because of the pandemic some of the kn95 masks have been approved by the CDC and FDA for use against the Corona virus but not all of them. Before you buy any masks you should go online to the CDC website and check to see which ones are approved. Also be very careful about buying a mask online because there are a lot of counterfeit masks that are being sold and it's very easy to get ripped off. Is there a difference between cloth and paper masks for effectiveness? Are disposable paper masks more itchy than cloth masks?"

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.  ,  Development of Your Thesis A thesis is the essence of your paperthe claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea.

402,Is it bad to flush vacuum dust down the toilet,"Yes in my opinion. Its unwise to flush anything that isnt human waste. It just causes potential problems at the sewage company, which can be expensive to remedy. Everything else should go into the waste basket of outside trash can, which is where I put mine. That way it goes into the landfill, where its expected. Is it bad to flush vacuum dust down the toilet? Does flushing the toilet with the seat down minimize the amount of germs projected in the air? My toilet  What is the optimal GPM for a toilet flush in an auto flush valve? Why does my toilet run water every few minutes? Why do I always have to flush my toilet twice to get everything to go down, and how do I fix this? Because baby wipes are not made from a paper that will break down dissolve but, rather, contain a raglike material for strength during use. Just because something will go down the toilet without a problem, does not mean it SHOULD be flushed You see, things that go down the toilet must travel through a rather long sewage system of a myriad of pipes to your waste management plant. If, by chance, your wipe actually does make the trip all the way to the plant, it will become clogged in the many and various pumps and filters designed to separate extraneous material from the human waste. When enough of these noncompostible items clog those filters, the entire system must be shut down and someone yes, an actual human must go down into the system to hand clean all of that junk out Can you imagine? Would you want that to be you? So, only human waste or animal waste, and actual toilet paper, should be flushed down the toilet Also, there are a number of products that state that they are flushable but do not break down like toilet paper. This is a marketing ploy for the consumer for our convenience  it does not mean that those items are compostible or break down as toilet paper does Just dont do it and your waste management folks will greatly appreciate it As a side note, I recently read a story, I believe it might have been in England but not sure, where a human being actually had to put in a diving suit  a complete scuba gear setup  so he could dive into a backed up reservoir of mixed liquid and solid human waste. Why did he have to do this? Because the sewage line was completely blocked by a huge mass of flushable wipes This dive exposed this person to all sorts of nasty bacteria and other gross things and when he was done he had to be washed off by a biohazard team with special chemicals Again, would YOU want to do this? Me either So, again, just dont flush anything down the toilet besides toilet paper and s 1 and 2 Hope this answers your question sufficiently Peace Why is it bad to flush babywipes down the toilet? They go down without any problem. Short answer No Dont believe the hype there is no such thing as so called flushable wipe. Long version Many may argue that wipes that are biodegradable and dissolve under 3 hours are safe to flush, but actually they are not. Why? The problem in Europe and also in North America, not mentioning other countries is old plumbing system that can't even handle 3 ply toilet paper or paper products made from bamboo. So in perfect conditions many wipes marketed as flushable are safe to flush, but we are not living in the perfect world. Add low water pressure, There is tremendous difference being flushable and if it actually should be flushed.  If the word biodegradable is used on a packet or inferred, that doesnt tell us how long it takes for the product to breakdown, nor if they are able to breakdown in all environments e.g. freshwater vs. saltwater. This is particularly an issue where the product contains plastic as part of the weave. We know the consumers often think because an item is labelled biodegradable, it can be safely flushed. Sadly that is unlikely to be the case.  ,  Can you flush wet wipes down the toilet? No problem will reappear as happened herenIn the mid 1970s I worked for an American burger restaurant chain in London in charge of electrical maintenance, called The great American success At the Kensington branch now a shoe shop the Iranian chef had a pet boa constrictor snake 3ft long which he kept as a mouse and rat killer at the restaurant rear kitchen. One day it disappeared and nobody could find it. The chef was very upset. At the front of the restaurant in the basement was a store room with the ladies and gents toilets next to it. At that time all the waitresses used to wear mini skirts as part of their uniforms. One evening while the place was very busy a loud screaming came from the toilets that it could be heard at the back in the kitchens as well as through the whole place So loud we thought a girl had been attacked, murdered or raped. The doorman, manager, I and one of the kitchen staff ran to the toilets expecting the worst. We rushed into the ladies and the doorman kicked the door to the stall open where the screaming was coming from. The boa constrictor had come out of the toilet just as the young waitress was sitting down The chef came from the kitchen and was overjoyed to get his snake back It was never reported as no member of the public was involved and the health inspector probably would have had something to say about mice, rats, and snakes in the restaurant The waitress and snake were unharmed. What happens if you flush a snake down the toilet? What causes my toilet to bubble when I'm using the shower? How do I flush a toilet without a handle? How do I clean up with water on a Western toilet? Will it cause damage to a toilet bowl if I pour a gallon of water instead of flushing the toilet? What is the optimal GPM for a toilet flush in an auto flush valve? Depending on the food, most likely yes. I once worked for a professor in his home, doing research work. Several times during the years I worked there, I went to use his bathroom only to find the bowl clogged full of food, such as strawberries. He had to order professional snaketools to unclog it. I never asked why he chose to try to flush his food down the toilet rather than just throw it in the garbage or start a compost heap outside he had plenty of yard space for one, so I have no idea what his motivation was. But in order to protect your toilet and quite possibly your septic, if you have one, its best to only flush toilet paper, and even then, go easy on the tp. If you flush food down the toilet, will it clog? Sure. Its smaller than that constipated turd you flushed last week. It will go down the drain just fine. If its alive, there are perhaps ethical questions about drowning it pretty quickly versus stomping it under your boot very quick or my preferred option using natural gas   methane to anesthetize and suffocate it. Or take it far away from your house so it can be caught and eaten by some predator before it can find shelter in a foreign setting. Or, if you know anyone with a pet snake, theyd appreciate it. Theres a likely a local Facebook group of reptile owners in your area. But for small dead critters like birds that fly into our windows? I usually just wrap them in a plastic bag, tie a knot in it, and toss it in the trash. Is it OK to flush a mouse down the toilet? Is it bad to flush vacuum dust down the toilet?"

404,What type of grime gets literally under the skin from all the things we use our hands to wipe off or clean and how dangerous can some things be,"All kinds of chemicals and dirt and in some countries there are things in puddles they dont have names for yet. Really you see HVAC people wearing silicon gloves just to protect their hands from fuel oil, grease and other contaniments that maybe present.Usually its just a precaution as in the sixties HVAC and plumbers didnt wear gloves very often at all. Usually just to keep from skinning their hands handling molten Soldiered cast Iron Pipes back then for residential sewer systems. What type of grime gets literally under the skin from all the things we use our hands to wipe off or clean, and how dangerous can some things be? What should we do to care for the skin? What are the worst things to clean? How can I prevent my skin from aging? What does bleaching do to the skin? What is the best way to get clear skin? You cant stop your skin from aging, but to make it show its age less and to lessen the effects of age, there are many good options. In my facial plastic surgery practice, I spend a LOT of time talking about skin care with my patients, as many of them have the same concern you posed in your question. Protect your skin from the sun. It doesnt matter what skin type you have, just protect it with high SPF 40 and reapply it after 2 hours if youre in the sun. Use whatever face washes, moisturizers, and nonmedicated products you want. There are several good options to choose from, and I would not spend a lot of money on these despite what everybody on this site and Instagram is trying to sell you. Use a Vitamin A derivative. This means retinol, and tretinoin RetinA. Retinol is available over the counter in its weaker forms, but the prescription strength RetinA is much much better, and there are a couple of products Renova and Refissa that are formulated with an emollient or moisturizer to balance the drying effect that these products have on your face. Dont skimp on this product. Get a good one and use it regularly after the break in period of getting your skin used to it. I tell my patients to start out with once weekly use for 2 weeks, then twice weekly use for 2 weeks, then every other day use after that. If you can use it more often, then thats great. Some people cant do this because they get peeling. Either way, if youre worrying about skin aging, then this is the holy grail product. Use a Vitamin C serum on your face. This is applied right after you wash your face in the morning, and there are several good products to choose from. SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic is the best, because they have done scientific studies against their competitors and have shown superior results based on clinical studies. To treat or prevent age spots, sun spots, or pigment changes, a 4 hydroquinone product works very well. In fact, it is the gold standard skin lightener. The Obagi Nu Derm system uses this, as do many other products. It is not available everywhere, and it is a prescription product in the USA, so you need to get it prescribed or buy it from a doctors office. Weaker strengths of hydroquinone can be found in over the counter products, but do not work very well. Microneedling treatments can help stimulate collagen in the dermis, giving your skin a vibrant look and feel. It thickens the skin, because collagen attracts water, and by thickening your skin, the fine lines and wrinkles are reduced. Laser Resurfacing procedures treat both the deeper skin to stimulate collagen production, and the superficial skin to even out skin tones. They are best done in combination with a medical grade skin care regimen, and can have dramatic results. My laser patients are some of the happiest patients in my practice. I have experience with fractional erbium laser resurfacing, as well as fractional CO2 laser resurfacing. Both can give great results when delivered by experienced hands, and can turn the clock back unlike any other treatment. To get the most out of it, pretreat your skin with a RetinA, 4 hydroquinone, and vitamin C serum, and resume this after treatment. Its the magical 12 punch that whips your skin into shape. IPL Photofacials can reduce the pink coloration that some people can develop over time. Rosacea can be a difficult problem to solve, and IPL is a great solution that treats this with zero to minimal downtime. They also have the added benefit of treating sun spots, or age spots, and have a modest effect on collagen production to improve skin texture. This is the best option for people that cannot tolerate the down time from a laser procedure or a medium depth chemical peel, though often times multiple treatments are required. Chemical peels work very well by disrupting the skin surface cells and replacing them with younger, more vibrant skin. Superficial peels to keep your skin looking great are for maintenance. To treat the skin, then a medium to deep chemical peel can deliver much better results, though there is a down time associated with the healing. The deeper the peel, the longer the downtime, and the better the result is. There is no cheating this equation. I know the list is long, but I wanted to make sure that the information was good and accurate. I try to mention brands as little as possible, as there are many good brands and products. For medical grade products, go to a doctor and make sure you are getting prescription strength. There is a false idea that the half strength that you can buy over the counter is half as good as the prescription strength product. I have not found this to be the case. Though its better than nothing, many times it just isnt strong enough to deliver the results that you can get from proper prescription strength products, which often times end up being cheaper than the stuff everyone is trying to sell you on Instagram. Natural solutions are great when they work in cases like vitamin C serum, but I dont spend too much time trying to be natural with my recommendations when people come to see me for results. I focus on products that work, and leave the nonmedicated stuff the feel good moisturizers and toners to my patients. Check out some results from laser resurfacing combined with optimal skin care below  ,   ,  How can I prevent my skin from aging?  ,  I will give to you the 10 Reasons Why Its Better to Clean Less Often 94 of individuals on the planet accept that it is imperative to keep up neatness in your home, as per measurements.

Why is it better to clean less often? What is lanolin oil? Lanolin oil is a secretion from sheeps skin. Its similar to human  Unlike sebum, lanolin contains no triglycerides. Lanolin is sometimes referred to as wool fat, but the term is misleading because it lacks triglycerides needed to be considered a fat. The purpose of lanolin is to condition and protect sheeps wool. This conditioning property is why the substance is now widely used in human cosmetics, skin care, and hair products.

Positive Effects of Cannabis Short term Relaxation One of the most well known and immediate effects of marijuana is relaxation. The moment you breathe in cannabis vapor , a flood of plantbased antianxiety compounds travel through your blood and into your brain. Within minutes of smoking, youll be able to breath a heavy sigh of relief and start smiling again. Creativity When you smoke herb, activity in a certain part of your brain increases. That region is the frontal lobe. In fact, within 30 minutes of smoking , this region is fully activated in your brain. This is the same region of the brain that is responsible with critical thinking and creativity. Pain Relief Natural compounds in marijuana cut in, disrupting the signals. THC and CBD interact with your immune cells by giving them instructions on what to secrete and what not to secrete. When you consume marijuana, those chemical pain signals stop. This lets you go about your day in peace. The herbs power as a natural analgesic works when its consumed via edibles or smoking. Sleep A heavy indica will put you to sleep fast and help you sleep more deeply . Cannabinoids like THC induce sleep. At the same time, they also extend your time in deep sleep. Bliss It may seem odd, but the effects of marijuana and the effects of exercise are really quite similar. After you workout, blissinducing chemicals like dopamine, anandamide, and serotonin are released in the brain. These compounds make you feel amazing. Appetite When you smoke weed, a couple of things happen that make you love your food. Long term Nutrients As neuroscientist and author Dr. Michele Ross calls it, cannabis is vitamin weed. THC and CBD are some of the most powerful antioxidants out there. Antioxidants are essential for reducing environmental damage to our cells. Each time we breathe in car exhaust, accidentally whiff some Lysol cleaner, or eat foods with residual pesticides, were breathing in chemicals that can damage our cells. This damage is called oxidative damage. Lower Average BMI Marijuana makes you feel hungry, but it also helps you break down what you eat. THC kicks your metabolism into overdrive. It stimulates cells in your digestive tract to secrete hormones that help break down carbs. Reduced risk of diabetes and obesity While weed is not necessarily a weight loss tool itself, it DOES help prevent you from gaining weight. Recent studies have shown that cannabis users have lower fasting insulin levels. Anti Aging As we mentioned earlier, THC and CBD are powerful antioxidants. Antioxidants protect us from DNA damage. DNA damage is the reason we age. Increased Qualities of life Many studies show that cannabis helps people cope with physical pain, traumatic events, and daily stress. Marijuana may just be the medicine people need to prevent these daytoday harms from evolving into more serious issues. Cancer, depression , anxiety disorders and degenerative disorders may all be prevented by cannabinoid therapy. Relief from Debilitating Diseases Studies are showing that diseases as varied as cancer , multiple sclerosis, Alzheimers, diabetes, arthritis, Chrons, posttraumatic stress disorder, and epilepsy may all be connected to irregularities in the endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is the largest cell receptor system in your body. Researchers are still uncovering discoveries about how this system works. Compounds like THC and CBD bind to receptors in that system, giving your cells a new set of directions. Marijuanas ability to correct some of these endocannabinoid imbalances is what makes the plant so important to us as a species. Are there any health benefits from marijuana?

Even as a professional with many products and methods at my disposal, it is rare that we can remove blue dyes. Its also a bummer for the homeowner because the stain might spread and get much bigger if you try any liquidbased cleaning products on it. So I dont know what you should do. Maybe you can just cover it with a rug or piece of furniture until you have all the carpet professionally cleaned and they can try to get it out. But like I said, Im not 100 sure.

Your carpet dries from the bottom up, so after your cleaning attempt, organic material left behind at the bottom may travel up to the surface to wave an ugly Hello at you we call this wicking, turning the carpet brown. Even when browning does not occur, the soaps and shampoos may create a tar pit, trapping every dinosaur or particles of dirt that happens by. Over an all too short period of time, these particles build up and give the appearance that the original stain has come back from the dead  it may even look worse than it did before Instead of using storebought carpet cleaners, go to your medicine cabinet and grab that brown bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide from inside. Youve probably been using this for cuts and scrapes all of your life, just like Mom did, but thats a bad idea. Peroxide will kill good bacteria as well as bad. It can be put to better use as a cleaner and mild bleaching agent. Take a spray nozzle theyre mostly universal and screw it right on the top of the brown bottle. Mist enough peroxide on top of the spot to get it moist, but avoid soaking it. Use your fingers to brush it in. It will take about eight hours to get the full effect, so go on with your life and come back to the spot later. If it hasnt worked well enough for you, try it again. You wont hurt anything. The best reason for treating your carpet stains with Hydrogen Peroxide is that it wont leave any residues behind. It comes in those brown bottles to keep it from turning into oxygen or water, and thats exactly what itll do over the course of those eight hours. Well, that, and hopefully fingers crossed fix your spot. Dont let the term bleaching scare you. Household hydrogen peroxide or H2O2 is diluted about 98, and the stuff we use professionally is much stronger and also quite safe for most carpets, which are essentially made of plastic. The chemical works through oxidation, by blasting the stain with oxygen. It wont permanently remove colors like the chlorine bleach you use for your whites when doing laundry. The exception to this rule is natural fibers such as wool dont use it on natural fiber carpets. While hydrogen peroxide is super handy to have around, it is not the beallendall magical bullet of DIY carpet cleaning. Sometimes, you have to bite that proverbial bullet and call in a professional.

If it is larger particles, seeds and pieces of food, Id say you have a rodent problem. Why does my basement always get so dirty easily? Me and my brother don't eat there and the basement is clean one day and dirty the next, so why does it get so dirty? Why are basements the creepiest place in your home? Should I make my basement into an apartment suite and let it out? Wouldn't that impede my privacy and my kids freedom in the backyard? What are the disadvantages of having a basement? Do houses in USA have basements? How can you make sure your basement stays dry? I had really bad moisture issues in my last home my dehumidifier would run 247 but was finally able to permanently reduce the humidity through a few small projects. First, do everything you can to get water away from the foundation. Install gutters around the perimeter of your house if you don't have them already. Use downspout extensions to get water an extra few feet out. If possible, bury your extensions using the black 4 tubing and a popup far away from the house. Secondly, I would recommend checking your basement walls for any cracks or plug leaks. If they are bad, get them fixed. Thirdly, I would use a membrane to keep out any additional moisture that is wicked through your foundation. I've had good luck on my homes using Drylok. Splurge and get the 30psiit coats better and is a superior product just be sure to follow the prep directions. If you have a concrete floor, you might also find it helpful to seal any cracks and apply a concrete paint or epoxy coating to also keep moisture from coming through there as well. Fourth, get everything off of the bare concrete floor assuming you have one. If you have a storage area, use shelves or pallets to allow air to circulate. If you have to allow stored items to touch the floor, try to make sure the bottommost item is a plastic tote. Lastly, get a dehumidifier. They work but use a considerable amount of electricty. Over the years this adds up to a lot of money and vastly increased the carbon footprint of your home. Because of this, I consider them a necessary evil. If you have a ducted basement you might also find it helpful to set the fan setting on your furnace to low. This would keep air moving around your house and may also keep the air from stagnating and becoming musty. Good luck How can you make sure your basement stays dry? Why does my basement always get so dirty easily? Me and my brother don't eat there and the basement is clean one day and dirty the next, so why does it get so dirty?"
442,Should I disinfect my books when I come back from school,"First, let me tell you how sad I am that you would be so fearful of this virus that you felt compelled to ask this question, though I do fully understand how a young person could fear the virus in this way due to it being constantly talked about in what, to most scientists, is a nonscientific manner. I do not know if you have a sanitary school environment where your desks and other surfaces are properly cleaned, but I will tell you that you are most likely, over 99, not to be harmed by COVID19 due to age and other factors, unless you are already in a high risk category from having a compromised immune system. Your school books will not do well with constant exposure to disinfectants, it will damage them beyond use over time, so no, I won't recommend disinfecting your study materials. Here is what you should be doing to protect yourself and others from COVID19. Wash your hands and face often with a good soap. Dry them with a clean paper towel. If you are sick you should stay home until you are well again. Do not allow stress to discourage or frighten you, this raises the levels of stress hormones like cortisol and others, that actually weaken your immune system. Be sure to eat a well balanced and nutritious diet when possible. Spend as much time in the sunshine and fresh air as is possible. Relax, enjoy your life, play, have fun with friends and family, keep a positive attitude and never let others steal the joy of youth. Notice I did not mention masks, because none of them help, nor are they worn and maintained properly. If you are going to cough or sneeze be polite and cover your mouth and nose, not only is this good hygiene, it is common courtesy and good manners. Use good quality soap and warm water, brush your teeth, use an alcohol mouthwash, and practice overall cleanliness and good manners and you will be fine. I do sincerely hope you have a great day and enjoy your studies. Should I disinfect my books when I come back from school? What is the safest disinfectant? How do I disinfect kids school books? When did doctors start disinfecting? What should I do if I damaged a school textbook? How do we disinfect our house completely? Which disinfectant must be used? It depends on a few things. Do your books socially distance? That is, does anyone else handle them, or do they spend time on unsanitized surfaces? What are they made of? The COVID virus tends to last for a while on smooth, hard surfaces, so a quick wipe down of the covers with a disinfectant cloth or tissue should do the trick. If a textbook has heavily textured covers burlap and such, you might consider a paper book jacket to protect it. As with anything thats handled by more than one person, frequent handwashing is wise. Should I disinfect my books when I come back from school? In the wake of the ongoing global health crisis, consumers are more dependent on accurate and uptodate online information than ever.

454,How often do you need to clean and lube a firearm I acquired a semi automatic shotgun that hasnt been fired in years It looks fine but the action is stiff,"The answer to this question will vary widely, depending on the gun and whom you ask. Some people clean their guns every time they shoot them. For something simple like a breakaction singleshot shotgun, you could conceivably NEVER clean it and not notice a difference in how it functions. Two things here though you arent clear what you mean when you say the action is stiff. All semiauto shotguns have pretty powerful recoil springs that would make their actions hard to work in any case compared to something like a .22 or a handgun. You also dont say if this is a gasoperated shotgun, such as the Remington 1100, or a recoiloperated gun, such as the Browning Auto5 or a Benelli. Gasoperated shotguns are quite a bit dirtier than recoiloperated types, and definitely need more cleaning. Either way, if this gun has been sitting around for years it needs to be stripped and cleaned with something to dissolve dried gunk on the moving parts, then lightly oiled. WD40 has a mild solvent in it, so it would work for the cleaning. Dont use it as lube, because it dries out faster than a lot of other stuff and leaves some residue when it dries. A gasoperated gun will also have small holes drilled into the barrel as gas ports, and these need to be checked to make sure they are clear. The only number Ive ever heard when it came to this subject is that a gasoperated gun should get a basic cleaning every 200 shots, which works out to eight boxes of shells. A recoil action could stretch this, but eight boxes is plenty of shooting for most people unless theyre serious clay shooters. How often do you need to clean and lube a firearm? I acquired a semiautomatic shotgun that hasn't been fired in years. It looks fine but the action is stiff. How often do shotguns need to be cleaned?

Rapid Hardening Cement It is used in speedy construction and early completion is required due to lack of time or any other reasons. It is mainly used in repair and rehabilitation works. Hydrophobic Portland Cement It is used in high rainfall areas to improve the shelf life of cement. The cement is given a chemical coating during the manufacturing process, that provides waterrepelling property, and the cement is not affected due to high humidity and can also be stored for longer period. Low Heat Portland Cement It is mainly used in mass concrete for dams and many other types of water retaining structures, bridge abutments, massive retaining walls, piers, slabs etc.  Which is the highest quality cement used in construction? As a 10 year vet of the construction industry, with 4 of that being spent as a foreman I can offer my perspective. You cant be soft, at all. It doesn't matter if you're a laborer, tradesman, foreman, supervisor, manager. There is no room for anyone being soft. Any sign of weakness and the fellas will exploit it. You need to be physically, and mentally strong in order to survive. If you show ANY kind of weakness. It doesn't matter if you're a good worker or not. You will be pegged as a whiner. As a result, you will never be able to fill a wheelbarrow fast enough. You will never work hard enough. You will be mocked relentlessly in order to weed you out. It honestly, truly depends on what type of construction you are doing. It also depends on what type of leader you have working alongside you. As a laborer, it is pretty much universal that you will be working very hard. It takes a special cut to survive as a laborer, and it is because of that that I grew to respect my laborers immensely. The reason I survived as a laborer is because I was able to eat untold buckets of sht. I did whatever I was told no matter how menial, or how hard the task was. Without reservations or complaints. You want me to shovel 5 yards of gravel out of the back of a 5 ton dump by hand? Sure where do you need it. You want me to carry buckets full of motor up a ladder to you on scaffolding? How much and how quickly do you need it? You need me to mark, and cut all these stones with precision? When does it need to be finished? You need me to haul wheelbarrows full of A gravel, up a hill, and level it to grade? No problem I did this because I figured everyone has to do their time. Everyone on the jobsite has worked hard and continues to do so. When a rookie comes in, they are given a harder time simply so they can prove themselves. When they do, the men back off and they earn themselves respect. It's the rookies job to not let the team down. I graduated from laborer to lead hand because I was able to see the big picture. If I completed a task, I wouldnt ask what I needed to do next. I would begin prep on the next task of the job without stepping on anyone's toes. I would never do someone's job for them, I would get it ready for them to do their jobs. If the scaffolding was completed and the masons ready to go. I wouldnt ask, I would begin staging the stones for them in their work areas, than begin prepping the motor for them to use. The foreman would than come to me and tell me I need you to start staging stones and get the motor ready its already done boss, and the motor is in the mixer ready to go just need to add water. I didn't mix it yet because I dont know if you guys are taking a break or not wha well okay, nice job. Good stuff, take your break. Fire up the mixer when break is done. Good work I developed a reputation for being a worker who never needed to be told how to do anything. Just tell me what, and it will get done, properly, the first time, with no complaints. With that being said, as a laborer I worked HARD. I would go to bed exhausted each and every night. But I loved that feeling as I felt like I earned the right. As a leader, it was just as difficult as being a laborer. Just in different ways. Being a leader it was my job to ensure everyone had everything they needed to complete the jobs. Material, equipment, safety gear, trucks, even assigning the right laborer to the right task, with the right crew. I also had to know and understand the big picture, as well as plan structure the job from start to finish. The way I did this was to set up a timetable. Each crew had daily tasks to complete. I assigned the tasks to the crew leads respectively, than left them to do their jobs. I didn't micro manage them. When their tasks were completed, and there was still work to be done. I would send them to help another crew as needed. At the end of the day we all went home at the same time. I was the first one on the jobsite, and the last to leave every day. At the beginning of the day I would take a look at what needs doing and make notes to assign crews according to the timetable. At the end of the day I would double check and triple check the work to ensure completion to code. During the day, I was still in the trenches working alongside the guys. That includes labor duties to cover for laborers that called in sick or quit which happened frequently At the end of the day, especially on fridays. I would have wheelbarrows full of ice and drinks for the fellas. You need to reward good work, and encourage it. So from laborer to foreman, I worked hard no matter what I was doing. The one thing absolutely no one wants to see on ANY jobsite. Is someone just standing around. ESPECIALLY from the leaders. If the laborers aren't pulling their weight, the tradesman will have to pick up the slack, and that will not only tick them off but slow things down immensely. If a leader just lazes around and expects everything to get done. The workers will resent that, and feel like they know better and begin to do things at their own pace which will slow things down. A crew is only as good as its leader. How effectively a crew works is a reflection of their leadership What is it like to work on a construction site? How difficult is it to work as a construction worker? Cement Cement is the main component of concrete. It's an economical, highquality construction material used in construction projects worldwide. Cement is made by grinding together a mixture of limestone and clay, which is then heated at a temperature of 1,450C. What results is a granular substance called  Some of the reasons for its popularity in construction site 01. Cement can be produced in large volumes in controlled condition, packed and transported. 02. Cement is a several times stronger binding material than lime and clay. 03. It can be mixed and used at will with locally available materials at site. 04. When stored properly in ordinary atmosphere it does not deteriorate for reasonably longer time at least 3 to 4 month. 05. When mixed with water, starts setting and gain sufficient strength in a day or two, where as other binding materials require much longer time. Hence increase speed of construction. 06. It can withstand compressive stresses well. Where tension and shear stresses occurs it gives good bond to steel reinforcement and transfers excess stresses to steel. 07. It is produced from the materials like limestone, hematite, bauxite, clay, etc which are plentifully available in the upper crust of the earth. 08. It imparts strength and durability to building elements. Not only that with cement, the speed of construction also gets faster. 09. It is comparatively cheaper material. I hope, you would get your answer. Thanks for A2A. What is Cement? Why we are use for construction? How do you get bids on post construction clean up jobs?"

Of these most are enveloped viral diseases similar to COVID and are easily disinfected with any common household cleaners or disinfectants. Several are bacterial diseases, for instance Leptospirosis, which is from fresh urine, and after only a few minutes this bacteria is dead. Similarly, plague, while deadly, is usually transmitted by fleas and is easily disinfected, and can be treated with common antibiotics like penicillin. Using any common, household disinfectant is probably adequate. Fresh urine is the real risk and that is easily treated.

Do face masks really matter even if they are made from cloth? What is the N95 standard for face masks? Why are N95 masks not advisable to be washed and used frequently? I was at the local Publix today and picked up a mask box.  ,  I suggest you read the box. This whole mask thing is a complete and utter fraud. Cloth masks are hopelessly worse than the surgical type masks like in this box. In medicine the acid test of value is Mortality Deaths and Morbidity illness. If deaths and illness are going up you are doing the wrong thing. We started all this emphasis on masks about June 1, 2020, It is July 18, 2020 and deaths and illness are up.

The protests really riots have dramatically accelerated the spread of COVID19 in the USA. They are at war against the USA and these riots are their battles. In a war germs always win every battle.

497,What ratio of bleach to water should be used to disinfect spills,"First wipe up as much of the spill and dispose of the paper towels properly. Household bleach is typically 5 1 4 percent active chlorine. It is in the form of sodium hypochlorite which is alkaline. This equates to 52,500 ppm of available chlorine. if the surface is heavily soiled, it should be cleaned first as the chlorine cannot disinfect the surface if it is prevented from reaching the surface by soils. A dilution of about 250 to 1 will provide over 1000 ppm of available chlorine which will disinfect. In the food industry we normally use 200 ppm to sanitize this reduces the bacterial population by 99.999 but does not disinfect. The higher levels will disinfect. I like the 1000 ppm because the chlorine can't distinguish bacteria and viruses from other organic matter and can be used up by any other organic matter around before it interacts with the microorganisms.

How many times should offices be cleaned or disinfected to prevent COVID19? Why should automotive brake lights be binary? Why do some vehicles have a center brake light and others of the same size class do not? Why won't my brake lights work? Let me answer this question for you. I near totaled my truck trying to avoid a line of stopped cars at a red light. My front,right caliper malfunctioned because I waited to long to change out the worn pads. The entire pad came out of the caliper draining my brake fluid instantly when I went to brake for the light. There was road construction on the right and a large bulldozer sitting there with soft,churned up dirt all around it. There was a small,yellow car in line that I was heading towards at about 30 MPH. I had but a few seconds to decide and react what to do. My main concern was to DO NOT HIT ANYONE. I swerved over into the soft dirt of the construction site with the idea of scraping up against the parked bulldozer to slow my truck and then jamming it into park if I needed after that. As I hit the soft dirt,my truck slowed considerably and I did not need to snuggle up to the dozer. Instead, I was now traveling slow enough to be able to jamb it into park,skidding to a stop. All this happened in seconds. Nobody even knew what was going on around them or how close they were to danger. My truck is a full sized ,diesel dodge. I got out shaking and saw that my brake fluid was all over the tire and wheel well. It ended well. I had called AAA and got towed home. The point of my story is DO NOT be a David Powell and put off maintaining good brakes. I figured I could go about another day before I installed new brakes as I had just discovered my front pads were near worn out that day when I backed out of my driveway hearing the familiar metal on metal sound and I damn near caused an accident. Never again will I put off maintaining my brakes. A lesson learned the hard way and a miracle nobody was hurt. P.S. I know I am going to get clobbered by readers who never make mistakes but I am writing this anyway in hopes someone reads this and learns from my mistake.

525,How are harmful cleaning products such as bleach removed from sewage during sewage treatment,"The chances that any chlorine bleach makes it all the way to the sewage treatment plant from your household are diminishing the small. Hypochlorite is a highly reactive chemical that reacts with most organic compounds. Since sewage contains many organic compounds, there's plenty of things for it oxidize on its way to the sewage treatment plant. Hydrogen peroxide will similarly decompose on its way to the sewage treatment plant. The only disinfectants that are likely to make it to the sewage treatment plant are benzalkonium chloride quaternary disinfectants commonly used in Lysol. Fortunately, they are active at very low concentrations so they are unlikely to present a major problem for the sewage treatment plant. How are harmful cleaning products such as bleach removed from sewage during sewage treatment? How does a sewage treatment facility clean the water of cleaning chemicals? How dirty is sewage water? Is chlorine strong enough to clean up sewage water? What are sewage treatments and its types? Is bacteria used in sewage treatment plants? First you must determine what kind of waste in your wastewater you want to remove or neutralize. You must also know specifically what properties of the receiving water or secondary use must be achieved. In most residential waste water, and many industrial waste waters, the largest fraction of contaminants are those which act as food for microorganisms, and in that metabolism, they consume the dissolved oxygen in the receiving water. This property in measured as Biochemical Oxygen Demand or BOD. Depletion of oxygen means fish cannot live. Common treatment to reduce BOD is to supply oxygen and nutrients in controlled environments lagoons, various activated surface devices or biofields. The above environments for BOD removal all require deliberately growing microbes. Any bleach will inhibit or kill those microbes, so bleach is just the opposite to what you wish do. Following BOD removal which thankfully also typically captures many other contaminants, the bodies of dead microbes is removed by settling or filtering. If some of the microbe population includes those harmful to humans typical if domestic sewage is treated, the remaining microbes must be killed before release. Bleach can be used in this stage, most common as UV light, ozone, peroxide or radiation. Chlorine or hypochlorite bleaches should not be used because these are toxic to fish. How can I use the bleach in wastewater treatment? how can I use the bleach in wastewater treatment? No. Bleach is neutralized in the sewer lines well before ever getting to the sewage plant. The amount of bleach used in an average load of whites is probably gone in the first 1,000 feet of sewer line. There's a simple reason the chlorine goes away. Chlorine is a very reactive element and loves to combine with other materials. Sewage has lots of solid materials in it that chlorine will quickly combine with. Industrial use of bleach is a different matter. A rag processing company with multiple massive washing machines can put very large amounts of chlorine in the sewage. The chlorine will still seek to combine with solid materials but if the facility is close enough to the sewage plant, you will have chlorine coming into the plant. Even so, it will be gone quickly after entering the treatment process. Is domestic bleach neutralised at the sewage treatment works? Wastewater Treatment is done in 3 stages, They are Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Primary Treatment In a  Secondary Treatment The secondary stage converts organic matter in sewage into stable forms through biological activities, resulting in secondary sedimentation. Common approaches are trickling filters and activated sludge method. Trickling filters comprise an enclosed tank with a bed of bricks and a layer of microorganisms. The effluent enters into the tank through an inlet and trickles over the bed layer by sprinklers. Microbial activities oxidize the organic matter in the effluent, resulting in the removal of fine solids, formation of sludge and effluent with less organic solids.  ,  The activated sludge method involves the addition of a mixture of active microorganisms to sewage, followed by aeration and agitation. The aerobic conditions and microbial actions oxidize the organic solids resulting in coagulation, flocculation, and settling of solids. Activated sludge produces a clear liquid without evilsmelling. Tertiary Treatment The effluent then undergoes tertiary treatment disinfection by the incorporation of UV radiation or chlorination. Depending upon the nature of the sewage and the effluent from the secondary treatment you can follow other methods such as sand filter and reverse osmosis instead of stage treatment.

When the copper cookware manufacturer Waldow Company of Brooklyn, NY went out of business in 1979 it was observed that its founder, Bruno Waldow, was in his 80s, the company was the last copper cookware manufacturer in the US, and none of his heirs elected to take the business over. However, when I met the buyers of the Waldow tooling and heavy machinery, they had a slightly different take on the demise of Waldows cookware business. Copper cookware sales had been sinking progressively through the 1970s, and while Waldows showroom did brisk business until the end, the wholesale side had been withering for years. Several other US copper cookware makers and retailers had rolled up in the preceding couple of decades, including New York stalwarts Chas. Ruegger and The Copper Mine. Waldows machine tools and other shop content were the only parts of the operation with residual value, and these were inexpensively acquired and put back to work in capacities other than making cookware. The cookware tooling went into storage. Waldows copper cookware business slowly crumbled owing not to quality issues or even coppers falling out of favor with accomplished cooks. Two forces combined to drive highquality cookware and Americans cooking for themselves into decadeslong decline The madeup conception of cooking as drudgery and the advent of disposable cookware. Like so many things Americans used to do for themselves, cooking has been progressively coopted by capital, which engineers value by manufacturing foodstuffs so you dont have to, extending shelf life freshness with elaborate packaging, stabilizers and preservatives, and progressively finding more and more links in the commercial foodchain for its government subsidized corn and soybased products highfructose corn syrup, chemicallyextracted seed oils, hydrogenated fats, etc.. All these values were spun as progress in advancing the interests of women in particular, specifically freeing them from hours spent in the kitchen. Much as we see corporations cynically paddling in the cultural current today, 50 years ago TV dinners were explicitly marketed as liberating and soap opera advertising jingled Why cook tonight? Call Chicken Delight Cookware itself became the equivalent of the old ballandchain, from which, again, corporations chivalrously offered to free women. More and more foodstuffs entered the household as heat and serve increasingly to be processed within that other great kitchen timesaving advance of the 1970s, the microwave oven. The handling and preparation of raw ingredients became associated with not having anything better or more important to do. Dousing and heating a preportioned, freezedried mix became associated with a modern, spaceage way of life. One of the great marketing phenomenons of the time, Hamburger Helper, required the addition of fresh or frozen ground beef  itself likely processed and packaged  intended to encourage a sense that one was still cooking. Often, however, a box was simply emptied into a pan of water, brought to a boil and served e.g., Mac N Cheese still as popular as the day it was introduced. Many of these convenience foods were largely starch based and fetishized as lowfat another tragic commercial mania, which often necessitated the addition of synthesized ingredients such as stabilizers, gums and syrups to make up for flavor and texture deficits many components of flavor are fatsoluble. Such manufactured preparations are, in a word, sticky. Starches are also exceptionally susceptible to burning quickly at relatively low temperatures the  In the 1950s a French company, Tefal, pioneered the application of the exceptionally slick byproduct of an industrial accident, polytetrafluoroethylene  Again, at the time this was all thought to be extremely progressive. Convenience foods would free women to join the workforce while providing their families with tasty and nutritious meals in minutes. This suited the convenience of large corporations very well, as most of these meals were comprised of a shrinking list of commodity inputs,  As Americans got thicker and thicker from steady consumption of cheaper and cheaper, nutritionally questionable manufactured foods, our cooking skills atrophied along with our health enter the pharmaceutical and medical industries. Wellmade cookware faded in importance along with a wellmade meal, and pots and pans themselves became thought of as disposable within the tidy, convenienceoriented kitchen indeed, many US apartments constructed in the 1980s and 1990s were equipped with just a counter, sink and room for a microwave, disposing as much with the idea as the necessity of cookware almost entirely. Even the most robust nonstick pan linings are reduced to flaking films after only light use in less than 10 years, and usually in less than 5, leaving essentially a useless husk of cheaply stamped metal flecked with plastic shreds. According to the Cookware Manufacturers Association in 2015, no nonstick cookware produced before 1999 is likely to still be in use. This fact represents a reliable replacement market for plasticcoated pans, but it also represents the addition of millions of tons of unstable and toxic polymerized petrochemicals to our landfills, and the infiltration of their byproducts especially  To the question of whether traditional cookware such as copper is outdated, the answer with respect to the foregoing would be emphatically  With minor upkeep, cast iron is in the same league as copper for durability, with many, many thousands of centenarian pans still in service in the US alone. While rust and caustic exposures can pit cast iron to the point of failure, lightly pitted and even heavily rusted pans can be resurfaced, reseasoned and put back to use. Refined iron, aka carbon steel, is likewise susceptible to oxidative degradation, but in most cases can be restored to service with minimal effort. Pure metal cookware is, as a practical matter, indefinitely renewable even as an ancient technology its as ecologically uptodate as solar energy and electric vehicles. That it is many times more expensive than disposable cookware accrues not only to its far greater utility for timetested and safe preparation of real foods, but to the facts that fabricating or casting pure metal cookware requires a lot of hand work and is today only a small fraction of overall cookware production. This results in far higher unit costs. However, one buys a tinlined copper pot or cast iron frying pan once and then uses for the rest of life, passing it down to heirs, and heirs of heirs. The lifetime cost of a new pure metal pan of any type, even with periodic restoration, is on average significantly less in both nominal and constant dollar terms than regular disposal and replacement of a pan with an intentionally short design life. Because the manufacturing costs of copper, iron and carbon steel on the secondary markets have been amortized down to zero, prices there are subject to simple supply and demand. There is a lot of supply of pure metal on the secondary markets these days, and often a good quality pure metal pan needing perhaps slight restoration can be had for a quarter the price or less of an equivalent new piece. Nearly any used pure copper or iron pan will perform significantly better than a brand new midtoupper grade stainless or aluminum pan of the same configuration, and will do so longer and for less total cost of acquisition and restoration. Its a triumph of marketing that cooking and the tools used to perform this most biologically essential task ever fell into disrepute. Fortunately, interest in decent ingredients, land and animal husbandry, the health of soils, the cleanliness of the water supply and, finally, the performance and material qualities of the tools used to convert raw nutrients into the energy by which we sustain and enhance our own lives, are filtering back into common consciousness. The wholesale abdication of our ability to feed ourselves to profitdriven enterprises has shifted incentives from nutritional value to shareholder value and from longterm stewardship to shortterm return on investment. The results are the despoliation of Earths surface, water and air, the ever tighter concentration of financial wealth, and ever larger swathes of humanity abandoned to the ravages of industrial malaise. Postindustrial communication techniques are enabling me to write and share this essay, so Im far from indicting the entirety of corporate modernity. As it applies to biology, ours in particular but also the planets generally, paying attention to how humanity provided for itself prior to the advent of adding dubious value for profits sake is, I think, instructive as well as desirable. Pure metal cookware predates the industrial revolution and has been been improved by it, but as ingredients in sound cooking modern pure metal vessels are functionally indistinguishable from those relied upon by humanity since antiquity. Is copper cookware outdated, or is it still desirable, but less common due to price? Does hot water help to remove grease from dirty cookware?"

They are not sent by God, angels, devils, demons, or spirits, good or bad. Theyre nothing that your subconscious mind is trying to tell you, only a byproduct of your brain as it is processing information. You might think dreams have meanings. I dont blame you people have thought so for thousands of years. You may believe complete strangers here on Quora with no personal knowledge of you, your culture or beliefs can somehow interpret or explain them, which is very curious to me. When you are awake, you are constantly receiving a barrage of information that goes straight to the brain. At certain times while you are sleeping, it gets sorted, filed away as memories, or discarded, resulting in your imagination going wild. The brain makes an attempt to create a narrative, often with bizarre results. This happens mostly during the REM rapid eye movement stage of sleep, which corresponds exactly as one is dreaming. You are much likely to remember your dreams if they are violent or sad or very emotional, especially if you are interrupted in the middle of a dream or shortly after having dreamed. Dream  Wikipedia Dream interpretation  Wikipedia What does it mean to dream of washing your feet rinsing it with water? I had a dream where I drowned and I saw my lifeless body. What does this mean?

When I saw it, I freaked out and told my dad to do it himself. What does that mean? Any recurring dream indicates a chronic vibrational frequency within you. And the layout of the dream experience such as symbols and imagery, can help indicate what exactly that frequency is and how it is triggered. Lets say for example that you experienced something in your life as a young person that was uncomfortable. Lets say it was an older brother who treated you like you were stupid. This treatment came in the form of telling you that your playful antics were silly and dumb, and stop acting like a child. Perhaps when you dressed up, drew him a picture, tried to tell him a story, his response to you was less than supportive. Got it? Okay, so now this is your path to overcome. It will be your job in life to find a way to love yourself enough to continue creating the wonderful things you create, regardless of what someone tells you. But if you do not do this, and because humans often have a tendency to repeat patterns, the next time you create antics or draw a picture there will be a fear that someone will call you stupid, and this pattern will repeat itself until you overcome it. Now, as an adult, several things happen when you have  Even though, as an adult you may feel that the brother doesnt bother you anymore.. if you were to meet someone, whether at work, in a coffee shop, in a relationship, or as your neighbor, that person or scenario will trigger the same response of fear within you. And you may not fully recognize why. So, you have a recurring dream about something, dimly lit, dirty, industrial, without privacy, and the most striking thing.hard to find. My first question is why do you want to find it? Its gross Ah.but you need it. Dont you find this interesting? Lets take apart the first few details. Dimly lit Cant see, cant find my way, perhaps scary, unclear, I am not sure what is lurking, no clarity..any of these giving you an aha moment? Dirty cluttered, unclear path, not my stuff, garbage, stuff that doesnt belong, someone elses stuff. Im just guessing here.you have to have the recognition. Industrial A place of work, not a lot of heart and soul, too big for what I need, loud, the workings of thingscan you come up with a few? Bathroom Why a bathroom? What does the bathroom offer you? A place to pretty up, get clean, wash yourself? What are you trying to wash off? Are you dirty? Do you just need to pee? Hide? Be alone? What? Without privacy What does privacy give you? When do you need privacy? When do you feel like you dont have it? What does it mean to have it? Where do you go to get it? Hard to find I will leave this one for you to decide. Your dreams are you, your own brain, your own emotions, your own conversation about YOU. YOU can figure this out. And when you do, they will move onto the next helpful path in which to navigate. Remember, a recurring dream is a recurring frequency, what in your life is like this over and over again? You have been ignoring it for a very long time. And this is a gift, you are doing great just by asking for help. But you are the one who must navigate this space. You are loved and you can do this. What do recurring dreams about gross bathrooms in big buildings or old houses mean? I dont know, but its an interesting image, isnt it? A shoe tree is a real thing. Perhaps you were making a pun in your sleep? I wouldnt worry about it. It means nothing. Except maybe, how it made you feel. Dreams are not magical, dont tell the future, and arent sent by spirits, demons, angels, God, or gods. Dreams are just products of our imagination. Many think dreams have meanings and believe complete strangers here on Quora who dont know them at all can somehow interpret or explain them. I dont blame people for asking dream interpretation has been around for thousands of years And dreams can at times be REALLY strange. Many think dreams are more than just the way your brain processes information while youre sleeping. Dream interpretation is just part of a spiritual belief system unsupported by meaningful evidence. When you are awake, you are, without being aware of it, constantly receiving a barrage of information, sights and sounds, feelings, etc. that go straight to the brain. At certain times while you are sleeping, it all gets sorted, filed away as memories, or discarded, resulting in your imagination going wild. The brain makes a narrative, tells stories in your sleep, stories which can be very complicated indeed but may not make any sense. This happens mostly during the REM rapid eye movement stage of sleep, which corresponds exactly as one is dreaming. It may even happen when you think you are wide awake. This is something all mammals experience. That dreams really dont mean anything is pretty much a fact.

Perhaps a recent fight with a friend or close one or maybe its career related, where you dont feel steady, and possibly in pain. Maybe its a course you are taking in college or your current work position, that you feel is not in alignment in where you see yourself in the future and its causing internal conflict.

Journal it, analyze it where needed and release it. Find a way to get back to love and being grounded. No need to hold onto the negativity. Fear crafts anxiety, pain, disease and so much more.

Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science and the 21stCentury Dream  Wikipedia I had a dream where I drowned and I saw my lifeless body. What does this mean? You are an observer. If you were being pushed around it might mean that you were not really in control. However, because you are more or less suspended above you are getting an aerial view closer to the ground. That is you are surveying as if your upper case SELF is showing your lower case self. Somehow you are supposed to learn from this view and figure out how you can grow psychological individuation because of this experience. Your upper case SELF is NON LOCAL, whereas your lower case self is the local. The difference again, is that your local sees things from the few cubic centimeters within the skull whereas the non local you sees things higher. The communications involves symbolism, similar to a physical dream language. This means you are in a fortunate position to consider happenings in a different light. Your spacing can provide insights into how you can maneuver from goal to goal, like traveling without having to run around in circles. So, your upper case SELF is elevating your lower case self and your body may get the sense of levitation.

What is the best way to unclog a drain? In North America, it is typical for toilet, sink, and other household drains to connect to a common sewer system. In cities, the sewer from each residence connects to a public sanitary sewer system that delivers sewage to a regional sewage treatment plant, which then treats the waste for dispersal to streams. In rural areas, the sewer connects to an onsite septic system that treats the waste for dispersal in the soil via a drainfield. Some older properties may direct the wastewater from sinks, bathtubs, and washing machines via a separate drain plumbing system directly to surface discharge, where it soaks into the soil or runs into streams. Wastewater from sinks is termed grey water from toilets is termed black water and generally doesnt contain the pathogen load that black water does, so poses less of a health concern. Surface discharge of grey water is common where the black water septic system is inadequate and can be easily overloaded, such as the old technology of  A cesspool is basically the same as an outhouse or privy pit, except that the waste is piped to it rather than being deposited directly. Because grey water can contain things that are harmful to the environment besides pathogens such as detergents, bleaches, and phosphates, disposal to surface discharge is now discouraged most building codes now require all drains to be connected to a sanitary sewer system. There is an effort to update codes to allow limited use of grey water for irrigation. Are sink drains connected to toilet drains? My rule is mechanical before chemical. Pros usually go this route too for good reason. There is a neat, inexpensive gadget found in home and hardware stores.

The length of this plastic has sharp barbs on the edges that, when inserted into a drain, will grab hair and other fibrous blockages, along with whatever bioslime is attached to it. Effective if hair is the cause and it is within the first foot or two. After this, a plumbers snake, a coil of wound metal with a spring coil at the end. This is cranked down a drain and snags all sorts of joy that Marie Kondo could do without. The ones you are likely to find have handcranks and can often do the job. The pros use these too, but when the stuff gets down to it, they have motorized ones that are appropriately labelled, Not For Internal Use. You are not likely to want to invest in one, for a oneoff. If mechanical fails, there is the chemical approach. Follow all directions and take all precautions including eye protection, ventilation, gloves and appropriate clothing. Dont do stupid things. There are two 2 forms Alkali potassium hydroxide, aka lye, commonly available in supermarkets, e.g. Drano. This stuff works well for most organic materials but is relatively slow to act. I find the liquid form to be more effective than the granular form. The granular form, if spent before gutting the clog, can crystallize into its own mass. The other form is acid, usually sulfuric acid. This stuff is nasty and is often sold only to professionals. I have a local hardware store that either does not know or does not care. This stuff will dissolve skin to the bone. It eats hair for breakfast. It makes litmus paper cry for mama. It is effective. We are talking face shield, doublegloves and a rubber apron here. It can make nasty fumes. But it works. If any lack of confidence, go get a pro. You do not need to learn Braille or be a social Pariah just to get a good shower with your ankles dry.

The above is a general response to the nature of the question and no specifics of application are to be implied or inferred. The response does not constitute legal or professional engineering advice. Seeking the advice of a qualified professional specific to your particular application, is recommended. Can I change my two drain sink into a one drain? How often should I clean the drains and vent pipes at my house to avoid to get clog pipes? How does a septic tank and drain field work? How do you clean out a kitchen drain that smells? Can you use drain cleaner with a septic tank? Ill tell you what several plumbers have told me when someone calls in with a sink that wont drain. First thing they ask is what have they done so far. If they say Draino or other similar product they tell them to just wait about a week. Then if it still isnt draining call them back. When they say they want someone now they say, Nope. Im not going to send someone out and risk them getting blinded or burned. That kind of stuff shouldnt even be on the market. I saw a beautiful little girl once, at least she was from her upper lip and above her lower lip and chin were horribly disfigured because she got into the colorful bottle under the sink. Some say you can slowly pour vinegar down the drain to neutralize it, but I would start researching that. You may be able to run a snake down it if the sink basket will let it in.  ,  They run about 10 and up some will allow a drill to be attached or come with one. And when it is safe, meaning the Draino has had enough time to dissipate or the vinegar does the trick but how do you know thats when you can start disassembling the drain under the sink and giving it some snake action. But then identify what caused the clog in the first place, like grease that is solid at room temp it is liquid when you cook with it but when it cools down it re solidifies, in your drain pipes. Note to selfStop pouring grease down the drain. In bathroom sinks, tubs and showers it is often hair that gets hung up on the drain mechanism. Learn how to disassemble it and from time to time take it apart, give it a good cleaning and put it back together again. Then again if you have an older house with metal drainpipes it may be time to replace some or all of them with PVC. Nice and smooth and doesnt rust. If you have a modicum of skills and some basic tools a lot of it you can do yourself, just make sure to study youtube is great what you need to do. The difficult part is knowing all the slopes pitches on the pipes because it is all gravity, hopefully whoever put the pipes in first did it right and you can just follow whats already there. TIPDo NOT do what I do, start this or any job at 900 at night because even though I have buckets of left over pipe, fittings, electrical, etc. it never fails, I realize I am missing one small piece and need to hit the storebut its 959. Start in the morning, that way if you need that piece the stores are still open. Ive tried using DrainO, but my sink is still draining super slowly. What else can I try? The methods you used are determined by the severity of the grease buildup. If your drain is running well, but you suspect there is grease building up, you might occasionally consider a hot water and baking soda treatment. CAREFULLY pour boiling water down the drain after you have poured some baking soda into the drain opening. A little more expensive, but a little safer no danger of spilling boiling water on yourself is to use a commercial enzyme cleaners regularly. Virtually every home store and most grocery stores carry them. Often people put them in the drain overnight and let them digest the grease. Do this on a regular basis, say every month, and you will keep your drain running freely. For very slow running drains, or clogged drains you may need more drastic measures. Caustic drain cleaners caustic  alkaline  lye are readily available. Draino Crystals are lye crystals and will cause a chemical reaction with the grease, create heat and melt the grease. Flush your lines with hot water after use. However, this is one of my least favorite treatments as there is much potential for injury. Wear eye protection and guard against splash back as the lye may boil the water in your trap or line and cause it to exit the drain opening with force. Lye can disfigure with chemical burns and cause blindness as well. I usually quickly put a overturned heavy pot or pan immediately over the drain after putting in the lye and recommended amount of water and stay away from the drain for the fifteen minutes or so needed to work. For those with a garbage disposal, manufacturers often recommend this trick to flush your drain lines of minor grease or other buildup. Fill up the disposal side of your kitchen sink up about halfway to three quarters of the way with warm water. You or a friend hold down the stopper on the nondisposal side of the sink. Turn on the disposal, then reach into the water filled sink and pull out the disposals stopper. The disposals impellers will suck down the water and discharge it into the drain line with force providing a cleansing action for your drain lines. I have had very good results keeping my lines clean this way  even resolving minor clogs and do a sink flush about every two weeks. Its fun to do, you dont have to use any dangerous chemical and it also keeps your disposal fresh and clean. How do I get grease out of my drain? Can I clean my drain myself?"

Oil stains the size of dining room tables, burnout marks from spinning tyres, and even rust stains from storing car parts in the weather, on otherwise clean concrete. I have seen 20 year old workshops with cleaner floors than my driveway now was. Every inspection had failed to notice it, because his car was always neatly parked right on top of the stain to hide it. I had to get a specialist company out to clean it  nothing I tried made a shred of difference. They charged 400, and the runoff killed the grass and several shrubs. I charged him the 400 against his bond, but footed the bill to repair the garden myself. I should have charged him for all of it. They did a good job  the oil stain is only just visible as one shade darker than the rest of the concrete around it.

The three types of gloves all ultimately provide a skin barrier to substances and items that its best you dont touch. Latex and nitrile are best used to protect against really hazardous materials, whereas vinyl is great for something of lowerrisk like food handling. Latex Gloves Best used when dealing with highrisk situations during the intricate procedures of surgery. Latex gloves are strong, flexible and fit like a second skin to offer increased dexterity, sensitivity and grip. They do, however, have the downside of being an allergen able to cause severe allergic reactions, so they can only be used when patients and clinicians are latex tolerant. Nitrile Gloves Made of synthetic material, these gloves are great at providing protection from chemicals and viruses and are great in situations where latex cannot be used. Thicker than latex, nitrile actually has the advantage of being even more durable and punctureresistant in the operating theatre. However, what you gain in puncture resistance you lost in dexterity and sensitivity. Vinyl Gloves Another glove type made of synthetic material and great at providing protection when doing lowrisk work like food handling. These gloves are very thin so provide the wearer with good dexterity and sensitivity, but they are also the most fragile and not safe enough when dealing with highlyinfectious substances. Powdered or Unpowdered Latex and nitrile gloves are usually available powdered or unpowdered on the inside. The powder is cornstarch which helps the wearers hands slide into them easier.

595,Can I use a bar soap on my face,"Hello there nWe at Superskinjapan would love to answer this question. because we have had quite a number of clients asking us about their athome skin care regimen and some also have popped the similar question as yours.  ,  If you are referring to normal bar soap, we wouldn't recommend it. Here's why  Most soaps are alkaline which means they have a high pH. Using soaps like this will strip your skin of natural oils and dry out your skin.  ,  There are however formulators that claim they use gentle ingredients and also fragrance free soaps. However generally the binders for bar soaps make the pH higher compared to facial cleansers. Therefore you often see pH 4.55.5 soaps for babies and facial soaps.

High pH soaps also will damage the outer protective layer of the skin. This leads to accentuated wrinkles and pores, and can cause acne and inflammation, which makes breakouts worse.

How frequently do steam locomotives have to refill the water in their boilers and the coal in their tenders? Can I drink vinegar and water to clear the system of weed? How much steam is produced with a 4ton boiler? This is an interesting question, so I did a bit of digging When the Duke of Gloucester project was in design, they considered the paucity of water available on rail tours, and decided on the following  Using the standard former British Railways water consumption calculation for Class 8 locomotives of 50 gallons of water to the mile, we determined that the operating range should be set at 200 miles, with a sensible reserve of water still in the tender.We thus determined that the most suitable type of vehicle would be a second tender, as opposed to other options essentially coaching stock variants or wagons for the following reasons There is a precedent for such a vehicle. In 1966 a second tender was acquired for 4472  It could carry around 6000 gallons of water, which, combined with the 5100 gallons in the main tender would give a total of 11100 gallons. This would give the required operating range of 200 miles with 1100 gallons of water in reserve. It would be relatively short little longer than a third of a coach length, something which might address any train length restrictions. So thats how much water they needed for the distance covered, with the amount carried in the tender. For the locomotive boiler itself, the water level would vary in the gauge glass depending on the rate of use and the incline higher for downhill than uphill to avoid the water disappearing out of the glass. I cant find the wet and dry weights of the average Pacific loco anywhere on the web it will take a lot longer than Im prepared to spend on an answer, but the boiler details for Tornado similar size A1 loco are  Maximum diameter  1.96m Overall length  8.89 m Distance between tube plates  5.17 m Using the distance between tube plates, and assuming that the boiler is full to the top, then the volume including the volume of the tubes would be 3.142 x 1.962 x 5.17   4 or 15.6m3 15.6t. Assuming that the boiler is around 90 full, then the boiler volume is 15.63 x .9   Using the heating surface area of both the small tubes and superheater tubes from Duke of Gloucester, the maths shows  if Ive got it right  120 small tubes and 43 superheater tubes, such that the total tube volume comes out at  So the volume of water in the boiler is the volume of the boiler minus the volume of the tubes, or 144.7   Specification  The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust How much water is in the Flying Scotsmans boiler to make steam? What do you want to clean? There are different chemicals for different types of dirt. I learned from professional building maintenance in my high school, decades ago, that most store bought chemicals do a very poor job compared to commercial grade cleaners, of which most are pure chemicals. Pure vinegar is a just a acetic acid, 5 concentration. Make sure its pure, not eating vinegar spiced up for taste with herbs or it will leave a residue. How well it cleans depends on how much dirt needs to be removed, and typically its light duty. For example, to remove odors on towels or clothes despite multiple washings, wash the load first with 250cc of vinegar and water alone to neutralize soapy residue on washed clothes, that leaves a rancid odor. Its color safe. You can also do the same with commercial bleach, 56 250cc per wash with water alone, but not color safe. To remove bathroom mold growth 110 6 bleach wipe down is all you need. To maintain toilet flow same, either vinegar, once a week into the water reservoir, then flush, but not bleach, unless you are sure there are no organic fittings made of natural rubber, e.g. the flapper valve. You can bleach the bowl, pour pure bleach 250cc into the bowl every 2 weeks to keep it clean. It will save you a ton of money as you can buy acetic acid, aka vinegar, and bleach in large quantities for very cheap, and they are environmentally safe, see the commercial section of cleaning supplies, not consumer.

In the past, many methods were used for wiping the rear end  for example Romans used a sponge on a stick as depicted in this reconstruction of a toilet in the North of England which still stands albeit roofless and doorless in the Roman fort at Chesters.  ,  Later on in the Middle Ages the famous and outrageous writer Rabelais, in his epic work Gargantua and Pantagruel concluded that the best method was the neck of a downy goose. Heres an extract  Adult content Afterwards I wiped my bum, said Gargantua, with a kerchief, with a pillow, with a pantoufle, with a pouch, with a pannier, but that was a wicked and unpleasant torchecul then with a hat. Of hats, note that some are shorn, and others shaggy, some velveted, others covered with taffeties, and others with satin. The best of all these is the shaggy hat, for it makes a very neat abstersion of the fecal matter. Afterwards I wiped my tail with a hen, with a cock, with a pullet, with a calfs skin, with a hare, with a pigeon, with a cormorant, with an attorneys bag, with a montero, with a coif, with a falconers lure. But, to conclude, I say and maintain, that of all torcheculs, arsewisps, bumfodders, tailnapkins, bunghole cleansers, and wipebreeches, there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose, that is well downed, if you hold her head betwixt your legs. And believe me therein upon mine honour, for you will thereby feel in your nockhole a most wonderful pleasure, both in regard of the softness of the said down and of the temporate heat of the goose, which is easily communicated to the bumgut and the rest of the inwards, in so far as to come even to the regions of the heart and brains. And think not that the felicity of the heroes and demigods in the Elysian fields consisteth either in their asphodel, ambrosia, or nectar, as our old women here used to say but in this, according to my judgment, that they wipe their tails with the neck of a goose, holding her head betwixt their legs, and such is the opinion of Master John of Scotland, alias Scotus.

616,How do you clean PC monitors without leaving streaks,"If they are dirty as opposed to just dusty I use Windex on a soft cloth or tissue. If corners are very dusty, first use a cotton swab to sweep dust away from the corners. Never push dust into the corners. Then if there are spots, scrub these first with a wet paper towel tissue. Then with Windex or some kind of mild cleaner wipe the screen with a sweeping motion starting from the top and working downward in long S curves. Spray the Windex lightly on the rag, not on the screen Then if I am feeling very particular and want to get rid of every possible streak, I wet a cotton ball with distilled water and buff gently. When distilled water evaporates there is nothing left but clean. How do you clean PC monitors without leaving streaks? Are there any 240Hz 25in 1440p monitors? What is the best desktop PC to run 3 monitors? How do you know if your computer monitor is bad? In terms of gaming, is 24 inches the optimal size for a PC monitor? What are some uses for dual monitors on a PC? Sorry to be that guy, but I would really recommend building your own PC. The thing is, your question is really tough because prebuilt PC sellers will do almost anything to rip you off. They often report a higher than retail price for the parts they use, even though theyre likely getting the parts at a bulk or manufacturer price. Then, they charge you 100 just for the build and usually another 25 to do a stress test which you can do on your own for free. If you really want the best deal, you should learn about what parts make up a PC, how they fit together, and which ones are optimal for your price point. Then, you can buy the parts off of amazon and put the PC together yourself, saving 150 which would cover most of the cost of your monitor. In general, if youre looking for a good monitor, you can probably get just about any monitor on the market on Amazon. If you want to browse for monitors, go to PCPartPicker. They have great search and filtering tools for exploring PC parts. https  pcpartpicker.com products monitor  If you really want a prebuilt, you should just go to random websites that sell prebuilts and search for the parts they use on Amazon or PCPartsPicker. You can see which websites are ripping you off and by how much. But again, you really shouldnt buy a prebuilt. Most prebuilts within the 3001,000 range dont even have 16 GB of RAM, and they use a slow speed often DDR3 instead of DDR4, when it would cost about 10 more to get 16 GB of good quality DDR43000 RAM. And 16 GB of RAM has been the LAPTOP standard for about 6 years. Where can I get the best prebuilt gaming PC and monitor? It depends on how many monitors you have, what size they are, etc 1 monitor this should be obvious, but ideally infront of you, unless youre using it as an Android emulator, then i guess you could try portrait. 2 monitors One in front of you and one to the side at an angle, side touching your primary monitor but angled to face you. this second monitor will be good for monitoring side stuff, videos that are playing, chat rooms, etc 2 curved monitors ideally these would be bezeless to reduce distraction, but position these monitors so they evenly take up your field of view, putting the point at which they meet dead center. In this position, you will have a very good ultra wide screen gaming experience. Not that great for monitoring chat or anything of the like as the previous setup though. 3 monitors Here is where you hit the sweet spot, especially if youre a streamer content creator. One in front, two on the sides, angled to face you. Center screen will be the game content, you can have chatrooms on monitor 2 whichever side you prefer, being right eye dominate, I prefer having chat on my left, many of my right eye dominate friends do as well, and then place the recording streaming software on your other monitor so you can monitor its status, bitrate, audio levels, etc This will also allow you greater confidence when youre being fancy with things like switching scenes for the video stream. This configuration also works well as it give you plenty of real estate for spreading your workflow on the computer, even if its just browsing the web or writing papers, the more that is actively open and ready to access by just looking over is a greater advantage than having to constantly switch tabs and windows. 4 monitors At this point, you will want to stack upward, keeping things as centered as possible. The 4th monitor should be placed directly above the middle monitor. If there is a 5th, keep the edge of 4 and 5 centered, similar to a pyramid. 6 monitors should be have it in a 3x2 configuration with the top three stacked directly ontop of the first 3. rinse and repeat until you hit 10 monitors. at that point you will want to start a new column of monitors to keep it all even, keeping everything as centered and even as possible. Note If you decide to go beyond 6 monitors, I hope you have a professional purpose for it ie. monitoring the stock markets. But at this point, always buy enough monitors to keep everything in an even cube, ideally curved at this point to keep it looking aesthetically pleasing. This is my basic suggestion. While there is far more to it, such as multiple monitors of varying sizes and aspect ratios, this guide should give you the basic idea of what to keep in mind  ,  What is the best position to put my monitors in a gaming setup? No one seems to have mentioned USB display adapters, so Ill mention them. Obviously, you need enough screen ports to connect all the monitors. Many modern cards support up to 4 monitors, but they are gaming cards. Older gaming cards are pretty cheap, and you can connect up to 8 or more monitors by installing two older gaming cards, or perhaps newer ones if youre a gamer. BUT What if you have a laptop or a smaller PC without space for big cards? The answer, which most people who want a lot of monitors know, is to buy USB video adapters and use these to plug your screens into a USB port. If you have a modern PC with USB3.0 slots, youll have no problems and the graphics are pretty fast. If you have older USB2.0 slots, you may end up with a bit of lag and a slow refresh rate on the USB connected video devices. But if they support USB2.0 they will still work  though resolutions can be limited on some  check the instructions carefully. Anyway, slower USB2.0 cards are STILL good for stuff like web browsing and spreadsheets and documents, which dont require high refresh rates, and save your PC connected screen for displaying any video or playing games. USB video adapters look like this  ,  Note This is NOT an endorsement of the above  Just an example image. I have not checked its instructions for suitability at all, I just did a search for such images, but they all look similar, like this, except some have HDMI or DVI outputs instead of VGA as this one does. Of course, youll need one for each video output, and youll need enough USB ports as well. But thats it  Easy eh? Just go to ebay and type in USB Video Adapters Unless the first to exceptions  can install either older or newer gaming video cards with 4 output ports  applies to you.

But with a little bit of work, one can figure out his  How much should I charge to wash cars?  ,  Heres a few tips and a detailed guide on how to was your car. Dont use a sponge No matter how careful you are, sponges can create light scratches and harm your finish. It all comes down to the shape of sponges  theyre flat. When wiping a sponge across your cars finish, youre essentially moving dirt back and forth along the paint. Many of these particles are sharp and can create even more swirl marks. Please ditch the sponges Do use a wash mitt Mitts dont have the same issues as sponges. Grit particles are absorbed into the mitts material when passed along the paint surface. Your chances of harming your paint is far less when using a wash mitt to clean your car. Dont use all purpose cleaning soaps or dishwashing soaps Household cleaning liquids are meant to be used in the house, not on your car. Many can actually harm car finishes. Most of the household products wont rinse off easily, could strip away wax, and some can even dry out your cars paint. Do use a quality car shampoo or car washing liquid Car washing soap is specifically formulated to easily and safely clean car finishes. Most are concentrated. Simply mix with water and youre ready to go. Some contain additives to help enhance shine and reduce water marks. StepByStep Guide Now that youre armed with the dos and donts, plus an understanding of the two bucket method, lets tackle the proper steps on how to wash a car by hand. 1  Timing Try to avoid washing a car in direct sunlight. If you dont have enough shade, try handling in the morning or late evening. 2  Tool Prep Using the two bucket method, fill one bucket with clean water. Fill the other with the soap mixture. Also set aside your mitt and plenty of towels. 3  PreSoak Optional If you have a foam cannon, lance, or foam gun, now is the time to presoak. If youre unfamiliar with foam cannons, theyre an excellent way to safely clean your paint. 4  Initial Rinse Begin rinsing off the car, from top to bottom. The goal is to loosen as much dirt and grim as possible. The more dirt rinsed initially, the less that will end up in the buckets. 5  Washing Dip your mitt in the soapy mixture and begin washing the roof of the car. Similar to the initial rinse, the idea is to move from top to bottom. As your mitt runs out of soap or becomes dirty, rinse it in the clean water bucket. Continue this step back and forth until the car is completely clean. 6  Final Rinse Completely rinse off all remaining soap, again from top to bottom. If you notice any dirty spots that were missing, go ahead and quickly wash with your mitt. If the entire car is clean, finish rinsing. 7  Drying Use your towels and begin drying, starting with the roof and hood. Dont forget to dry off side mirrors and all windows. Depending on the weather, you may need to towel off your car quickly to avoid water spots. 8  Tires  Wheels You may have noticed we left out tires and wheels in these steps. Ideally, its best to clean these separately. Dirty wheels are full of brake pad dust. Its extremely abrasive and can harm a cars finish. Given this, dont use the same buckets for your tires and wheels, the crosscontamination can do more harm than good. 9  Next Steps Congrats, your ride is clean If your finish is in good shape, now is the time to apply a quality car wax or paint sealant. Or, if you need to remove swirl marks now is the time. How do I wash a car? What are some car washing tips? What is the best and quickiest way to wash a car?

Im moving out from my rental apartment. The owner fixed a date for me to attend the handover. Should I be present? How can I get my tenants to clean up the place before they move out? Is it proper when moving out of a rental to clean a carper even though it wasnt clean upon moving in? Are renttoown houses a bad idea? Is it a good idea to move to a new rental place during CoViD19 situations? You do not indicate if this situation involves a member of the U.S. military. If this is a case of U.S. military personnel abusing your trust and your property, I would recommend writing a letter to the command structure at the base and provide documentation of the lease agreement the individual signed you do have a lease, right? along with photo documentation of the damage you do have before and after photos, right?, along with any information that the military would use to establish identity and service e.g., copy of drivers license or military ID. You did make a copy for the tenant file, right?. I would make the case that said individual was the tenant, had signed an agreement that outlined the responsibilities of tenancy, and had not lived up to those responsibilities. The military of the U.S. take responsibility very seriously. Once tenancy and written responsibilities are established, then documentation, including three estimates for repair, should be provided. Also, I would reasonably account for my time needed to resolve the issue as well as the amount of time that the rental unit cannot be occupied by a paying tenant due to the repairs necessary. I would place those amounts as two line items in a spreadsheet. Military professionals prefer, and work best, if the list is concise and easy to follow. If it were I, I would summarize in the last paragraph my appreciation for the commands help in resolving the matter, as I would hate to see their sterling reputation tarnished and realize the commands time is quite valuable, so any time given would be greatly appreciated. I would also consider whether inserting somewhere in the letter that you are in the process of securing a real estate lawyer to help protect you during the process, but that attorney will only be consulted to make sure you are doing things properly. I would also use an amount on the spreadsheet for the cost of repair to be half way between the middle estimate and the higher estimate. Doing so would establish reasonableness in expectations. I would send the letter by registered mail so I would have documentation of who received the letter, and when. This probably will not be a fast process and realize that not all command structures are cooperative on such issues. I would make an ask in the letter that whoever is assigned to deal with this issue in the chain of command, give you a call once it is received, so you can establish a personal relationship with that individual. Document their name, rank, and contact information, and how they prefer to be contacted email, text, phone call, etc. for your file. Also, after a quick consult with my attorney on this issue, I would keep the attorney informed of where things stand. The military, from my experience, would prefer not to deal directly with your attorney, but they should be made aware that you are being advised by one. That way the military knows that if they do not deal with you appropriately, then they will probably have to deal with the lawyer. The military absolutely does not want to deal with a lawyer. Once the issue is brought to an appropriate resolution, I would accord the officer that assisted you with a hand written thank you along with a small token of gratitude a fruit basket, tickets to a movie, something, and a typed letter of commendation to the base commander expressing my gratitude of that individual and for the commander making the wonderful decision to place them in charge of your complaint. That way, if something like this should happen again, or perhaps if someone they know needs a place to rent, you will be rememebered and well regarded. I wish you a quick and easy resolution to your poor impression of the service as a result of this occupant. My tenant in the military has trashed my house before moving out, what can I do? No, at 13 you cannot start to move out. The way the law works is like this, your parents are responsible for you until you are 18 years old. Meaning, by law they have to support you by giving you a room and a bed. Give you food to eat, money to buy your own clothes. And pay for your cell phone service. Once you turn 18 you are then considered a full fledged adult and your parents cant stop you if you want to move outta their house. But, it is not always necessary. If you do pay your parents a rent, it might be better off for you rather than to be on your own. Mom cooks you home cooked meals. Mom does your laundry. If you are on your own, you do this for yourself. But, heres the thing, by the time you are 18 years old, you should have a parttime job. So that you are able to support yourself, pay your parents a rent for your room and board. Be able to pay for your cellphone bill. Have a rent if you want it. Or, move out then you pay a landlord a rent. In order to do this you need a job. If you choose this route, the landlord is going to want to see your work order permit from your guidance counselor office. Which you should obtain when you are 16 years old. And, your landlord is going to want to see your work paycheck stub receipts for at least 6 months, as proof as to how long you have been working. once you have been approved to get this rent, the landlord is going to need one months rent  one months security deposit. All to be paid at once. And to be COD, cash on delivery. All rents are to be paid in cash only. All rents are for one year. The security deposit is returned to you when you decide to move out. Provided that there is no property damage to the landlords rental property. The security deposit cannot be used to help pay for your rent. It is not to be used for that purpose. It is for the landlords use, to repair any damages that he discovers after you vacate the property. And, you should get a lease agreement to sign, so you know your start date is, and, when your end date is. You do not have to move out, on your end date. It only means if you dont want to renew your lease, that is when you need to be out of the rental space, and return the keys to the landlord. What age can someone start to move out? Can a 13yearold move alone? How clean should a rental house be before moving out?"

648,How do you clean a felt cowboy hat,"First of all, any water or any wet treatment is a last resort only. Start by brushing all over with a hat brush. Yeah, thats a thing. There are special brushes for hats. A NEW horsehair shoe brush will work, too. Then hit it with a lint roller, and brush one more time. Apply cornstarch directly to any remaining dirt, or stains. rub it in gently with a dry sponge or a small artist brush. Let it sit a few hours. Brush with the hat brush again. Repeat as needed. Finally, dust the entire hat with cornstarch and brush it away. This will take a while. You can also use a dirt devil or dust buster type small vacuum cleaner. Goopy stuff like tree sap, chewing gum, etc can sometimes be removed with a brown gum eraser. This really is a job for a hatter, though. I removed some varnish from a Stetson I wore briefly, with acetone, a toothbrush, and a shop towel. Left a mark but the varnish was gone. Thats when I decided I didnt need any expensive hats anymore. So, onward. Pull the sweat band down and let it air out for a day or two. Hit it with baking soda or talcum powder, let that stay for a day or two to absorb sweat odors. Brush with the hat brush. Any further treatment should be done by a hatter or at least a dry cleaner who has a lot of experience with good felt hats. If the guy actually wears a hat himself, thats a good sign. A hatter can block your hat for you, as well, and maybe replace liner, sweatband, anything that needs it, same time. A good hat isnt cheap. It is worth a few bucks to overhaul it. Stubborn? Determined to do this on your own? Okay, if you still got dirt or stains that wont come out, take a spray bottle of woolite and spray the entire hat lightly, not just the stains. Keep it damp but not wet for an hour or so. Brush it off with a dry or barely damp sponge. Repeat the cornstarch and hat brush treatment one last time. If it still looks dirty, its a work hat or a fishing hat or whatever hat, now. Dont try to wash it. I saw that once. Ended badly. How do you clean a felt cowboy hat?

652,California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out I did not do any damage it was normal wear and tear at most By the time he said he is going to bill me I have,"In California, a manager has 21 days to do an accounting for the deposit. I am certainly hoping that before you moved in, you took the time to photo document in detail what the condition of the unit was, and then again when you moved out you again meticulously documented the condition of the unit. That would be your best defense against claims of damage. In California, the manager was required to offer you a Premove out inspection. I find these to be nearly worthless. You cant possibly know until someone has moved out what cleaning they will do. I always offer the inspection, as required by law, but in the decade since the law went into effect, I have never had a single tenant ask for one. However, if you were not offered the opportunity for this inspection, It will hurt the owners chances of making any recovery. If you have relocate overseas, the manager is going to have a hard time serving you for a small claims action. And you will have a hard time suing them for return of your deposit. Practically speaking, you will probably lose your deposit and that will likely be the end of it. California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out? I did not do any damage, it was normal wear and tear at most. By the time he said he is going to bill me I have already relocated overseas? Can my past landlord affect my credit because I left my apartment dirty but did not ask or recieve my damage deposit back nor did I recieve a bill or itemized list of the charges. How would I resolve this? Do I need to pay my rent if the landlord promised me to replace the stuff that needs to be fixed in the apartment before I moved in? Can a landlord rent out an apartment that is not movein ready? If I break my lease and move out early, how will the landlord know where to find me to sue me for the back rent? Why is my landlord saying I didn't pay him when I did? Time and again many sites report on what to do when signing a lease or terminating a leasebut like always that advice is ignored and the landlords take full advantage of the tenants' ignorance. Your definition or wear and tear will vary vastly to his, and he will always claim that even if you never occupied the place, there was damage caused that allows him to keep your deposit. Regardless of what you do not paying is the obvious onehe will put in a default credit notice, out of spite California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out? I did not do any damage, it was normal wear and tear at most. By the time he said he is going to bill me I have already relocated overseas? What is your question  do you have to pay the damage  yes unless you can prove it was not there when you left   but you mention it was sone what u consider wear and tear may not be  you also could question the 800  but that should have been done on an inspection when you were leaving are you asking how to pay for overseas? There are many way to do that California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out? I did not do any damage, it was normal wear and tear at most. By the time he said he is going to bill me I have already relocated overseas? Ignore it. If there was a security deposit, he will keep it, and you would have to sue him to get it back, which isnt worth your effort since you are out of the country. There isnt much the landlord can do to you if there isnt enough of a deposit to cover it. But if he is retaining your deposit, he is required to send you the statement that you received. California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out? I did not do any damage, it was normal wear and tear at most. By the time he said he is going to bill me I have already relocated overseas? Can my landlord use my deposit to redecorate after I've moved out? How much do landlords usually raise rent? Is my landlord allowed to come into the house whenever he wants? What can I do legally if my landlord is coming in when I'm not there? Is it okay to let my landlord check in my apartment before I move out? He is just pulling shit. He can only try to go after your credit history. He knows you cant fight it. You dont have pictures, he want either new paint etc. I would send back refusal and take it up with credit bureau if he puts it on your credit history. Not a lawyer, this smells fishy, 3 weeks is too much time, who would wait that long? California What do I do if landlord send me a 800 bill for cleaning and damage 3 weeks after I move out? I did not do any damage, it was normal wear and tear at most. By the time he said he is going to bill me I have already relocated overseas? You are screwed on your deposit.

653,How does phosphoric acid remove rust from metal,"It neutralizes iron oxide rust, firescale to form a salt, iron phosphate, which then partly dissolves in the concentrated phosphoric acid, a reaction which slows down once the acid reaches the metallic iron underneath. Whatever carbon there is in the iron will remain on its surface as a sootylooking film which can easily be scrubbed off with water and a stainless steel scouring pad. If phosphoric acid is used primarily to remove firescale Fe3O4, some of the iron II phoshate will salt out as a greenishwhite slurry on long standing. This is Fe3PO42. Using phosphoric acid to remove rust Fe2O3 will result in iron III phosphate salting out as finegrained, orangebrown crystalline chunks of FePO4.  How does phosphoric acid remove rust from metal?

Pledge is great for the exterior for an easy wax job. Concentrated degreaser mixed with diesel fuel or kerosene was most effective on dirty engines. Commercial engine cleaners also worked fine.

658,Can you use too much Lucas fuel injector cleaner,"Lucas is a well known product line but their products are somewhat over rated. They count on a certain percentage of their customers to over indulge, if a little helps, then extra would really help sort of thing. You will never here them say  Use it sparingly because too much might cause damage . Truth is its basically just a lubricant that dissolves in fuel. The concentration would have to be extremely high to cause any issues with your engine. On the other hand, any more than the recommended amount is simply a waste of money, but it lets their cash register do the happy dance more often. From my experience products like Marvel Mystery Oil and Seafoam do more of a thorough job of cleaning your fuel system including injectors. Can you use too much Lucas fuel injector cleaner? If the fuel injectors are clogged, will the fuel consumption be crazy? Does changing fuel injectors improve performance? What happens when gas turns milky and clogs fuel lines, rails, and injectors?

Im personally a big user of Lucas in all my vehicles  have been for years. I follow their instructions, I have doubled the amount at times.

662,How do I soften and recondition old leather that had dried and hardened,"Well, it depends on how bad it is and also on what this item is, which you didnt mention. Sure would help to know what leather item has dried and hardened. If its something like a bridle it may help to soak it in some lukewarm water until it softens. Dry off with a towel and then slather on some good quality leather condtiioner, ideally in a liquid form. Coat all sides of all the parts and then set aside to dry where the air is not too warm or too dry. With some luck, itll regain enough flexibility that you can work some more conditioner into it. But a lot depends on how badly dried it was and for how long. If it was leather bookbinding then Id never try to restore it myself, Id get a professional to look at it. If its a pair of boots or shoes, soaking and conditioning might work. If its clothing, you could try that too but garment leather is usually fairly thin and it would be fairly easy to use too much conditioner so that a jacket or pants would feel kind of greasy, assuming it worked at all.

672,My doctor s office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now,"Thats a very perspicacious question. Cleaning, and other hygiene measures, take time and money. Both would detract from the care available. As with everything in human society, a sensible balance needs to be struck and the risks and benefits assessed. When I was a youth, there were stringent rules on visiting people in hospital  restricted visiting hours, limits on the number of visitors, dont sit on the bed, etc. Often presented as Dont excite the patient, these were really infection control, just as the prohibition on patients getting out of bed. Nurses would mop floors and surfaces with carbolic several times a day. All this was gently relaxed as antibiotics became available and as personal cleanliness improved. Then came MRSA, and ward doors stayed closed, cleaners had to discard overshoes and gloves for every space, gel dispensers appeared everywhere, and visiting rights spiralled downwards. There has always been a costbenefit balance struck. My local GP has always taken chairs out of the waiting room and varied appointment availability during the coldsnflu season, for example. My doctors office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols. Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now? What should I do? My supervisor at a hospital where I work is stealing patients toiletries such as toliet paper, toothpaste, Lysol wipes, hand sanitizers, etc that are left at the main desk by family. Due to COVID19 this is the policy. Why are dentists' offices generally nicer than doctors' offices? Why do people think they can call a doctors office and speak directly with the doctor? What happens when a patient walks out of a hospital without being discharged by the doctor? Why do doctor's offices tell their patients to schedule an appointment to see the doctor when the patient is already not feeling well? No, they didnt sanitize, not that much. The worst place to get sick has ALWAYS been at the doctor's office. Its a scandal that has never been properly addressed. I spent several years as a caregiver for seniors. I always cringed when I had to take them into the doctor's office for exams or treatment. And I always took disinfecting wipes with me and wiped the heck out of their hands several times both during and after visits. I cared for one adorable little lady with dementia who was handy, she loved tactile anything. She wanted to touch, to hug, to handle everything and every time we had to go to the doctor she got sick with something. Doctor's offices, especially in the US, are all about money. More patients seen faster  bigger profits. Its a rare and special doctor who treated fewer patients and took the extra time to do real cleanup and wipedown in their offices. Ive only known one. And shes now retired. My doctors office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols. Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now? Here in Scotland doctors are sanitising rooms after seeing each patient. Of course normal cleaning was carried out previously but Covid requires surfaces in the rooms to be wiped down between patients. Our first line medical practitioners are carrying out phone consultations and then seeing patients only if necessary for examination, blood tests etc. Its surprising how effective the phone consultation is and in my experience is sufficient for many circumstances. The doctor has asked for photos to be sent once or twice, has reviewed these and then written a prescription. Seeing fewer patients keeps the medical staff and patients safe so everyone here is going along with these new procedures. My doctors office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols. Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now? COVID19 sanitation is more extensive than normal, even to the point of allowing rooms to be vacant longer between uses. My doctors office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols. Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now? My doctors office said they are seeing less patients due to their new sanitation protocols. Did doctors offices not sanitize the rooms before covid and why would there be more work now?"

676,Do I really need a professional emergency plumber to clean a clogged drain,"You may not even have to even it is at high tide. If just a minor clog you can probably move it along with a Plumbershelper the toilet sink plunger. That is one thing everybody should have, but you can get at the hardware. Remove most of standing water as to keep from sloshing all over. Then put over the drain and plunge away. If works, you should hear movement and for sure when you take plunger of drain. If you now have flow you are good and add back some more water and do it again. In most cases you should be good. If does not work you might have to remove the drain trap under sink area. Will need some more tools and also cover area with bucket to catch water. If you are not comfortable with this step may be the time to call in a plumber. But go for the easiest  cheapest step first. Do I really need a professional emergency plumber to clean a clogged drain? My drain is constantly clogging. What could be the cause? What are the worst things plumbers find when they are called to fix plumbing issues in old houses? If a plumber must open a wall in your house to access a pipe, who is responsible for patching it after the repair is completed? How often should I clean the drains and vent pipes at my house to avoid to get clog pipes? Is it cheap to hire a handyman or a professional plumber do to some plumbing repairs at my house? Shitty plumbing.  Seriously, some of the stuff is outrageous, and the only way that things havnt gone sideways is sheer luck. I did one house with a 3 4 main copper water line into the house, it went down to 1 2 before the meter, then back to 3 4. Now your typical house is supplied by 3 4 per now, 3 4 copper is more fixture units because its less restricted flow, but 1 2 even in copper is not enough for a house. So we were called out. So I had the city come shut the water off, inspector checked out the meter because we were modifying it and we went to work. Cutting the supply line after the meter. I cut the pipe once and the whole thing fell off the wall. This house had been done for 20 years with an unsoldered copper joint. Somehow it just held. It would blow your mind how often we find this stuff. But thats not the worst. The worst is duct taped gas lines seriously where someone had cut into a wall with what looked like a sawzall and cut the gas line and just duct taped it back together and left it. Or nails through corrugated gas lines didnt leak for a long time cuz the nail filled the hole.. but eventually two dissimilar metals you get electrolysis, and the hole opens up. The really scary stuff though, is when people have unfinished basements with kids. The kids always complain in the winter that its cold in the basement, so often guys will see this especially in newer homes  ,  Except taped all the way bagged up. Theres a pipe that goes down near the floor, its open to the outside air, its called the combustion air duct. See most new houses are pretty tight construction, they dont let a lot of air transfer in or out, so we have to bring air in from outside so that when the furnace kicks on it pulls in air oxygen to replace the air oxygen used during combustion. Yea. But people dont know this, just know this pipe is drafty and cold air is coming in, so they tape a garbage bag over it to stop the cold air getting in. And in the process create not only a situation where they are now depleting their basement of oxygen, but also, messing with the available oxygen for combustion which creates incomplete combustion, which means the furnace doesnt run right, because combustion isnt complete, which makes soot buildup and or carbon monoxide production. Which is deadly and a huge fire hazard as spot is highly flammable. Coupled with kids rooms in the basement.. you get why this is so scary. number one cause of a Dirty furnace is blocking of the combustion air intake. In the summer its a non issue, in the winter when its cold, its killed many people. What are the worst things plumbers find when they are called to fix plumbing issues in old houses? In the years I cleaned drains I never found drain cleaner turning to cement. Liquid drain cleaners would only work if the clog was hair in the ptrap and the rest of the drain was clear. Kitchen sinks accumulate a lot of grease that eventually coat the inside of the pipe and you end up with a small hole through the length of the grease buildup. People pour drain cleaner in and it softens the grease and turns into a thick gooey blob. The drain cleaner contains acid. The cable I used to clear the pipe is made of a special spring steel and contact with acids shorten the service life of the cable. I would pour as much of the customer's baking soda they had to neutralize the acid. There have been several times over the years I refused the job because of the acids the customer used. The cable I used was expensive and I'd lose money because of shortened cable life. Having said that back to clearing the blob. The only way to clean the pipe is to fill the sink full of water while moving the spinning cable back and forth inside the pipe. With the pressure of the sink full of water and the moving cable eventually the soften grease can be moved to the sewer pipe and washed away. Liquid drain cleaners only work on a few occasions and that a plunger would be better used. You could even be charged extra because of the damage acid does to plumber s equipment. Why do plumbers not recommend you use house hold drain cleaners? I had a sink not unclog with a commercial drain cleaner and had to call a plumber. He said to never use a drain cleaner as  Here are some tips to unblock your Kitchen Sink  ,  1. Baking Soda  Vinegar Mix 1 3rd of a cup of baking soda with 1 3rd of a cup of vinegar in a measuring cup. This should cause an instant fizzing reaction, as quickly as you can pour the mixture down your  2. The Effectiveness of Boiled Water First, fill up the kettle to its maximum capacity and boil. Pour it down the blocked drain slowly in the stages, allowing the water to have an effect for several seconds between each pour. 3. Caustic Soda  Sodium Hydroxide Pick up some from your local hardware store, start by pouring  gallon of cold water into a bucket along with 3 cups of caustic soda and stir well with a long wooden spoon keeping your hands as far away as possible. This should cause the liquid to heat up and fizz, pour it down the drain and leave for half an hour, once this is done flush the drain with boiling water. 4. Using Dish Detergent Firstly pour  cup of dish detergent down the bowl and boil a full kettle of water. The detergent will be used as lubricant which will help get rid of any unwanted residue. After this you want to get the toilet plunger ready, Pour the boiled water down and put the plunger to use. 5. Wire Coat Hanger Solution Another simple way to fix your blockage problems involves just a wire coat hanger, hot water and patience. Straighten out the wire hanger and shape one end into a hook shape, use this tool to simply fish out anything that may be causing the blockage. I think these are the cheap and easy steps to unblock your drain. How do I clean a kitchen sink drain? Do I really need a professional emergency plumber to clean a clogged drain?"

What should I do? There are articles on the internet that state that kitchen cutting boards are dirtier than toilet seats but it may or may not be true depending on the level of hygiene one maintains. Toilet seats are dirty and contain microorganisms for various obvious reasons. Kitchen cutting boards are said to be sorry coz they're used to cut vegetables, meat, fish etc. So when one uses it to cut meat and fish, there are chances that the microorganisms present in the body of the fish and meat can be passed on to the cutting board and can remain there for a long time if the cutting board is not washed properly with soap and clean water. The microorganisms that adhere to the surface of the cutting board and remain on the cutting board due to improper cleaning can contiminate other food that may not be initially contaminated and consumption of this contaminated food can lead to various diseases.

How can I clean the grease off my stove? How should I clean a greasy table? Can I leave the door of a wood burning stove open? Why do we see oil or grease on the wood utility poles? How much stock should you typically take off on each pass of wood through a planer? The best defense against any type of grease or oil is dishwashing detergent and hair. In fact, these two methods are so effective that they are used by environmental groups to clean up crude oil spills, one of the most difficult environmental disasters to rectify. I dont know if I would use hair on my stove, but the detergent is a go. What I normally do is to use a dry, clean cloth to soak up any pooled or gelled grease. Then, I rinse that cloth in very hot water and add about a tablespoon of dish detergent to it, rubbing the two halves of the cloth together. Next, I wash all of the surfaces with the cloth, making sure that I continue rinsing the cloth and adding fresh detergent. If I have burned on, caked on grease or heavily gelatinous grease from a spill, I use half of a Brillo pad, using hot water to make it soapy and afterwards, rinsing its detergent off with the washcloth described before. This entire process takes elbow grease, but most dish detergent is environmentally friendly and very effective. The best way to keep the task relatively easy is to do this after every cooked meal. I personally break down the entire stovetop by removing and cleaning the grease catchers and the surface on top and underneath after every meal. Yes, I do have OCD, but it is far easier to clean it a bit at a time than waiting until everything is baked on. How can I clean the grease off my stove? How do you get grease off a wood range hood?"

It will skin over and be dry to the touch, but it needs to remain plastic to flex with heat, pressure and expansion  contraction forces of a threaded joint. It is primarily put on pipe threads as a lubricant to reduce friction in order to get a tighter fit. It does have a sealant component to the concept, once the joint has been completely tight. Once that tightness or torque has been reached, the sealants use has changed from lubrication friction to sealant. It is for this reason that dryness is not a good quality for a pipe thread sealant. It must remain flexible for the life of the joint for at least two reasons primarily, to make a sealed joint and secondarily, to be able to take apart at a later date.

709,What type of dishwasher detergent is less likely to gum up and build up as residue inside the dishwasher,"I have no American market knowledge but in Europe and Australia none of the wellknown brands clog the machine unless the dishwasher itself has a problem. I did see clogging in a few commercial premises when Industrial detergent was used and I did see it when no name corner shop or environmentally friendly detergents were used in conjunction with short or cooler programs. All detergents from the market leader Finish work well as long as the machine is correctly set for the water supply and the right program is used. Fairy are also good as are a few of the big supermarket own brands, but with the latter you have to sample them to see what works for you. Here are a few additional tips or things to watch out for Tablets are great but they are not all the same. Many people assume that all tablets are All in one detergent, rinse aid and salt function Theyre not, there are several that are purely detergent and rinse agent and salt Depending on water supply are needed. All in one tablets cannot cope with extremely hard water and are wasted if used where the water is very soft. If you live in a particularly hard water area and want to use tablets you should set the softener Salt setting to partly reduce the water hardness and you should set the rinse agent dispenser to a low setting give a little additional help with the drying. If you mainly use the most economical cool washes periodically run the most intense hottest wash to clear any built up residue. What type of dishwasher detergent is less likely to gum up and build up as residue inside the dishwasher? Why are dish soap and dishwashing detergent two different things? Why not just make one single product that works for both uses? Why do people insist on buying dish washer detergent packets when the machines were designed to run most effectively on liquid? What methods can be used to unclog a dishwasher? How do I stop my dishwasher from leaving white powder on dishes? How can you get dish soap out of the dishwasher? Im not quite sure what you mean by Crust but will assume that you mean food that has dried onto the dishes. If this is the case here are a few tips that may sort out your problem Make sure that the machine is set up properly and the filters and arms are clean. If you are on a hard water supply and need to add salt into a chamber within the machine make sure that the machines salt use or regeneration level is set accordingly. Look online for the water hardness in your area and in the manual for the setting Dont let the food dry out and form a crust in the first place. After the meal Scrape the excess food from the dishes and load the machine and run the pre rinse. This will remove runny foodstuff that would otherwise dry like egg and sauce. When you load the machine do it with the surface of the plates exposed to the water jets that spray upwards from the revolving arms below the baskets. The water coming out of the jets needs to get to the food on the items inside so make sure that the plates are not packed together too tightly. If your machine is plumbed to a hot water supply change it to a cold supply. Protein type food like egg goes hard and bakes onto the dishes if it is hit by hot water. I have never encountered a single real dishwasher that doesnt have its own built in heater element so although the cycle will take a few minutes more the transition from cool to hot water will make the wash far more effective. This excludes those odd Indian and Chinese hand turned plate washers Try different cycles. Do not constantly use the quick cycle for general washing. As with clothes washing the quick was is a compromised wash and should only be used on slightly dirty plates etc. A longer wash with a pre rinse will work best. Try different detergents. They really arent the same, try and see for yourself.  ,  Why does my dishwasher not get the crust off the dishes? Ill guess that youre asking about the differences between liquid dish detergent made for handwashing dishes and dishwasher detergent. If thats what you want to know, they are different because they must be different to function properly. Detergent for handwashing is made to cut grease and not be overly harsh on one hands. Detergent for a dishwasher is much harsher and not safe to use for handwashing. Its made to work only at much higher temperatures than you could stand on your hands and is much harsher to make up for the lack of friction you get with handwashing. The word soap is used interchangeably for all sorts of cleansing products, but genuine soap is made from two basic ingredients that occur very naturally in nature, fat and a strong base, usually lye. Its a solid product that is most often sold in bars. Detergent is synthetic, can be made into a liquid, a solid or a gel and depending on the ingredients, be mild on skin or very harsh and damaging to skin. They cant make one single product that both washes dishes safely by hand and would work in any dishwasher so they are very different things. Why are dish soap and dishwashing detergent two different things? Why not just make one single product that works for both uses? The powder buildup is hard water deposits from the detergent or from your home water supply.  Use a mild acid such as vinegar, Lemi Shine, Cascade Dishwasher Cleaner, Finish Dishwasher Cleaner, Dishwasher Magic or Affresh Dishwasher Cleaner to dissolve and rinse away deposits. The first cleaning will likely require several treatments. You may want to pause the cycle to allow the product extra time to work in the lower pump section. My favorite product is Lemi Shine, because it is just citric acid. Effective, inexpensive, and leaves a pleasant scent.  Many people use too much detergent. If you rinse your dishes, you can get away with as little as one tablespoon of detergent per load. In the future, use the minimum amount of detergent that gets the dishes clean.  Liquid dishwasher detergent has a nonsoluble powder in it designed to cause the product to flow properly. Powdered dishwasher detergent actually dissolves better than the liquid. Consider switching detergents.  If you want to keep your current washing habits, just perform another dishwasher cleaning cycle each month or as needed.  How do I stop my dishwasher from leaving white powder on dishes? What works better in a dishwasher gel detergent, or powdered detergent? What can I do if my Frigidaire dishwasher is not drying? What do I do if I accidentally use a laundry detergent pod in a dishwasher? Can a damaged dishwasher heating element break something else? How do we get our dishwasher to clean better? Manually massage the hose to break up any hard clogs. Undo the hose and clean all related filter parts and fittings. Buy a drain snake spring cleaner and poke it a lot. If you have a garden hose, go out and flush it through. Buy some washing soda crystals, fill a large bowl with very hot water and immerse the hose, ensuring the whole length is filled with the solution. Rinse out with Hot water. Reattach the hose and put half a packet of soda crystals in the empty dishwasher with half a litre of white vinegar. Put it on a long wash cycle. Perform the last step every two months, but importantly, remember that the dishwasher is only really a hot rinsing machine, you should prewash and especially remove any grease and food debris before you place items in the dishwasher . What methods can be used to unclog a dishwasher? How do I clean a clogged dishwasher drain hose? Hello there If your dishes are not coming out clean, the problem may not be your dishwasher, but the detergent you are using. Use a high quality detergent or consider switching to a powder detergent for better cleaning results. Clean out the detergent dispenser cup and make sure it is not clogged. Make sure you stack your dishes properly too. If the dishes are not properly loaded, the spray pattern will not be able to reach all areas of the dishes resulting in poor cleaning quality. Checking your waters quality is also important. Hard water will result in the soap not dissolving well and the dishes will have a film on them. Even the use of commercial products designed to remove the spots will not improve performance in this situation. The water should be about 3 4 The heating element, located at the bottom of the dishwasher, maintains the temperature of the water. Most dishwashing soaps will not dissolve unless the water temperature is at least 140 degrees. On most newer dishwashers, there is a thermostat that will not allow the timer to advance unless the water temperature is correct. If hot water is going into your dishwasher, but the temperature drops during the cycle even with a heating option selected, the heating element may be defective. If these tips do not fix your issue, you can find more information here  Why is my dishwasher leaving my dishes dirty? Most dishwasher detergents are formulated to rinse off cleanly and not build up. But, that is for water that has been softened. Hard water is a problem and can prevent dishwasher soap from dissolving completely. You might want to clean your dishwasher occasionally by running it through a wash cycle with a couple tablespoons of citric acid. I think its sometimes called Fruit Fresh. I just buy it bulk. You can also buy dishwasher cleaning agents at the store I you like. Some people swear that running a cup of white vinegar in a wash cycle does it. It didnt seem to work that well for me. What type of dishwasher detergent is less likely to gum up and build up as residue inside the dishwasher? If your dishwasher is gumming up, its likely not the detergent at fault. None of them are likely to be significantly better than any of the others, they just smell nicer and are a different colour. Every so often, youll have to determine the time, just run it on the hottest program with no dishes. That will keep you going until you find out what you are doing wrong. PS, ignore the detergent ads. When they say things like washes twice as clean as , they dont usually tell you cleaner than what, probably no detergent at all. What type of dishwasher detergent is less likely to gum up and build up as residue inside the dishwasher? the short answer is yes.nthe dish drain hose usually has an air breaker in one of the holes in the top of the sink usually building code regulated the other options are the air breaker is mounted in the cabinet above the bottome of dishwater and above the disposal unit if no air breaker, then the drain line needs to be elevated as high as possible in the cabinet above the disposal and above the bottom of the dishwasher. the whole idea is not to have any water draining back into the dishwasher and spilling out on to the floor. Does a dishwasher drain hose need to be elevated? So you poured some liquid soap for hand washing dishes into your dishwasher and realized your mistake before you hit run. No problem. Take out all the dishes and any removable racks and set them to the side. Now take a damp washcloth and wipe out all the liquid soap inside the dishwasher. Take another damp washcloth and go over everything again paying extra attention to the soap holder and to the bottom. With nothing in the dishwasher set it for a short cycle without heated drying and run it one time. While thats running take all the dishes and removable racks you set aside and wash and rinse them by hand. Set aside to dry. Once the short cycle is done put the removable racks back in the machine and you should be ready for the next time. How can you get dish soap out of the dishwasher? How do you remove dish soap from a dishwasher? Dawn is a very good dish washing detergent , ideal in removing gum up residue inside the dishwasher.

724,A dripping water noise is coming from my toliet Its not leaking water the flushing mechanism is intact and functional and no water appears around the toliet on the floor Whats causing the dripping noise,"My 1st guess would be that either your toilet fill valve is not fully shutting off, I would start by removing the tank lid when you hear the dripping sound, and making sure the water level is below the fill line usually around 1 below the top of the over flow tube. If it is at the top of the tube it is usually adjustable, next check the little tube that goes from the fill valve to the over flow tube, if it is dripping you need to replace the fill valve. I usually use the Fluidmaster 400A which is available at most home improvement and hardware stores. turn off the water to the toilet using the control valve at the wall, flush the toilet holding down the handle until as much water leaves as possible. Now remove the supply tube from the wall control valve to the toilet fill valve. Then either remove the left over with a shop vac, or place a small bucket under the fill valve and remove the fill valve catching the water in the bucket. Next install the fill valve following the instructions for installation and adjustment, reconnect the supply tube and.turn on the water and check for leaks. My 2nd guess would be that the flush valve flapper may be leaking slightly. Unfortunately many of these are now toilet specific. Often Youtube will have a video showing how to replace you specific flush valve or repair it. If you are lucky and it has a standard flapper, turn off the water to the toilet, using the control valve at the wall, flush the toilet holding down the handle until as much water leaves as possible, remove and replace the flapper also, clean the surface where the flapper sits as sometimes residue can be left there that can cause the new flapper to leak, and.turn on the water allow the toilet to fill, and flush a few times. While cleaning this surface check for pitting of the surface. If it is pitted or rough sometimes it can be smoothed out with steel wool, if not you may need to replace the entire flush valve assembly which Fluidmaster also makes an assortment of as well as a fairly universal repair kit. Just follow the instructions. A dripping water noise is coming from my toliet. It's not leaking water, the flushing mechanism is intact and functional, and no water appears around the toliet on the floor. What's causing the dripping noise? For sink faucets that have a separate side sprayer, can the faucet be installed without the sprayer? How can I identify which water pipe is going to my apt? There are 6 water pipes exposed on the roof but they all go inside the wall at one point where each one goes to a different apt. The exposed length of each pipe is short less than 0.5 m Can I put a water softener in my house if I dont have a floor drain? How do I fix a slow draining toilet? When flushing the toilet some water is leaking out of the bottom  how to fix this or do I need a new toilet? It is possible one of the toilets is newer, and is a low flow toilet. From the getgo, these use less water to make a flush, but in some instances some of this design from the earlier implementation of low flow toilets were known to not flush as well. More modern designs direct water better in more of a jet to add some push, so that even thought there is less water available, it does the work of higher flow toiletsSo it might just be you have a fairly old toilet, and and intermediate aged toilet. Another option is that the float arm may not be adjusted correctly, and you may not have the correct amount of water filling the water tank. This could certainly cause the need for multiple flushes, as the water in the bowl must reach a certain height to cause a flush to take place, even with no ahem restrictions blocking the trap. To check this is the case, take the lid off the water tank, and flush the toilet once. Note where the water rises to when it refills. Often, the float arm will have a slight bend to it, such that you can slightly loosen or tighten the thread on one side of it to adjust the position the float arm sits when the water reaches the full level. A slight pivoting of the arm can add a bit of water to each flush that can get it to the point where it flushes with one press of the lever. While you are looking in the tank, check for bricks. It was suggested in the 90s to add a brick to your old high flow toilets, to reduce the amount of water per flush. Someone may have done this, but the setup on these older high volume flush toilets really doesnt work as well with reduced water flow, so while it might somewhat function, if you have to flush twice, and the water saved is only 1 4 of the tank volume, then you actually end up wasting another half tanks worth of water by doing multiple flushes, which defeats the purpose. If it isnt working, and there is a brick in the water tank, try removing it, and seeing if the flushing improves, and if it does, skip the brick. You might also look to see if automatic bleach tabs are gumming up the works. The bowl cleaning tabs usually do well at keeping the water blue and the bowl cleaned, but if too many were used prior to previous months being used completely up, there may be some buildup or residue that is blocking some of the flow. The same might be true if you have hard water, and deposits have built up around the flap. Conversely, the rubber stopper flap that allows the toilet to flush may be leaking. If you flush, and note the toilet periodically kicks the water back on long after you have flushed, even an hour or two later it just kicks in, you may have a leaky flapper. This can mean that the water level is low, leading to a less powerful flush, the same as the others. In general, taking the lid off the rear water tank, and making some observations on both tanks to see what is happening different may be the best way to troubleshoot what is going on. If they both appear to function normally under the hood, then it may just be that one toilet is of that intermediary design, that struggles to flush as well as the older high flow, and new low flow designs.

Cleaning marble can be worrisome, especially for those new to its care. It is essential to avoid every day, harsh cleaners, and it is equally important to look into cleaning routines and products that will clean and protect marble effectively and efficiently. When the right products are used and directions followed, marble surfaces should last indefinitely. Top Marble Cleaning Products Here are a few of the top marble cleaning products, both name brand and natural, that have been proven to be beneficial when caring for marble.

Castile Soap Castile soap is mild and is an excellent more natural choice for cleaning marble. Organic varieties are best used as they are free of additives and fragrances. Simply use a teaspoon in a spray bottle with water. Shake it and spray it on the marble. Wipe it with a damp cloth and further buff it out with a chamois cloth once the area is dry.  Rubbing Alcohol Isopropyl 99 Rubbing alcohol is another more natural and less expensive way to clean marble or other natural stone surfaces.

A chamois cloth can also be used to buff out the surface. Beneficial Tips Do not use cleaners such as ammonia, vinegar or bleach as these products will etch marble, which equates to discoloration, dullness, spots, streaks, and rings that will likely be left on the marbles surface. Do not use popular everyday cleaners like Lysol, Tilex, Windex, Lime Away, CLR and almost every other household cleaner, as they are simply too harsh for use on marble and they, too, can etch and damage the surface of the marble. Do not use bristly pads or abrasive cleaners on marble. Either one will scratch the marbles surface. Try to avoid general off the shelf cleaners that are labeled for use with marble. Many times these more generic cleaners are ineffective. If you are thinking about utilizing marble in your home, or you have inherited a marble kitchen or bathroom, there are definitely positive ways to keep those surface areas in prime condition. It comes down to utilizing the right products whether they are name brand or doityourself.

But what can we do after those filters get dirty?  ,  If we could reuse our HEPAs, thatd be perfect So I asked Smart Air engineering intern CK to test it out  ,  Vacuuming the HEPA First, CK tried vacuuming the HEPA. It was simple. He went to our storeroom, took 8 dirty HEPAs, tested them, vacuumed them, and tested them again.  ,  Heres the HEPA before, during, and after vacuuming. Testing Effectiveness CK tested effectiveness in three ways. Particle Capture   ,  Air Flow   ,  CADR  Vacuum Results On average, vacuuming increased CADR by about 10.

Breathe safe Can I clean my cylindrical air purifier hepa filter with a vacuum cleaner to prolong its life? Or does this process damage the filter further? If your vacuum is bagless then you should be emptying it and cleaning the filters every time you use it. This is important because bagless vacuums rely on multiple filters to keep dust and fine particles from redistributing into the air when the air vents from the vacuum. When these filters aren't clean, the vacuum loses suction and the motor works harder making it more likely to overheat. If your vacuum is a bag type then it may have either washable or replacement filters or a combination of both. The bag itself acts as a filter as well. The ones that require replacement filters will have a recommended schedule or the filter may have an indicator strip. In general, you should replace them at least once a year, but again, follow the manufacturer recommendations. Something to note about washable filters is that they should be 100 dry before you put them back into the vacuum. If you let them air dry for 24 hours before putting them back, that is usually enough time. If you put a damp filter into the vacuum and then use it, the fine dust particles will get stuck in the filter and form a sort of stucco that makes the motor work harder than it should to maintain suction and it is no longer effectively trapping dust. A damp filter sitting in the vacuum will also sour and smell awful the next time you turn it on. Happy cleaning How often should you clean the filter in your vacuum cleaner? Would cleaning the cabin air filter every time with a vacuum cleaner make it as clean as a brand new one?"

For how much time should I soak clothes in detergent before washing? Why isn't my washer getting my clothes clean? Yes, you can wash your clothes twice in a row. Ive done that on a semiregular basis Why? Because one time through is not enough we live in a sea of mud and grease and dust. Also, because sometimes they get washed and forgotten, so by the time I come down to the basement to run another load and realize that there is already a load that has sat in there for two days, its really time to wash them again. It reminds me of the days before permapress materials were invented. Before that, shirts were made out of cotton and they were sprinkled with water, folded up, and then ironed, only after they were evenly dampened. I have vivid memories of the steam from the iron coming up into my face, during ninety degree days in August, and that was before anyone I knew had air conditioning. The main problem was that if they sat there too long, then they would get tiny bits of MOLD on them, and they all needed to be washed again. That was the incentive to keep up on the ironing What do I have to look forward to?

775,Is disinfectant the same as bleach,"No, although Bleach does have disinfectant properties it does a lot more than just kill germs. Disinfectants are designed specifically to kill microrganisms such as bacteria and some viruses. Typically they do this by breaking down proteins. Bleach can do this, but it can also cause chemical burns to skin and damage other substances significantly as well. Many disinfectants use alcohol to kill microrganisms. If strong enough 7080 pure it is quite effective, though some types of alcohol should not be used on skin as it can be absorbed with toxic effect. Copper has natural disinfectant properties, killing many harmful microrganisms with prolonged contact. Cold can kill some bacteria and viruses while heat kills others. As you can see, there are many choices for disinfecting various surfaces. Bleach is an undesirable alternative for many of them. So although Bleach can be used to disinfect, it is not the same as other disinfectant substances. Is disinfectant the same as bleach? Can I utilize bleach in order to eliminate mold? How do I make a natural disinfectant from COVID19? I used vinegar and bleach in the same room but they did not come into contact. Could the fumes mixing be toxic? We can disinfect with a bleach 1 teaspoon and water 8 oz. mix. Why does it have to be discarded everyday and remade? How does adding water make the bleach ineffective in a short period of time? Is it safe to use a dishwasher liquid detergent that contains bleach after previously using a detergent that warns against being mixed with bleach? Well, disinfectants work by denaturing the proteins in the viral sheath if the covid19. To do that requires a fairly strong chemical. And some of those strong chemicals are pricey, some are toxic to humans if accidentally ingested and have other issues with them making folks who are used to be environmentally conscious wish for something greener. But, they need to work, too. So things that denature protein .Heat UV light, ultrasonic vibrations. Concentrated strong acids or strong bases. Soap. Alcohols. Nonpolar solvents. Heavy metals. Oxidizing agents Okay, so you can't use the heat one, since you can't put your counters into the oven. You can't use ultrasound or UV light, since the equipment is very expensive and dangerous if used incorrectly. You can't use acids or bases, since they can seriously burn your skin and are toxic if ingested and would remain in the surface contaminating food. You can't use heavy metals since they are toxic if ingested and would remain on the surface and transfers to food, making it poisonous. You can't use nonpolar solvents since they are flammable, can spontaneously combust in the presence of oxygen and can trigger lung issues in many people. That leaves soap, alcohol and oxidizing agents, such as bleach. Soap works well, but must get the surface very soapy, allow it to stand several minutes and thoroughly rinse it off. This is inconvenient for surfaces, but perfect for your hands, clothes, dish towels, sheets, etc. Alcohol to work it must be over 60 alcohol. The only natural, nontoxic alcohol is ethanol. Places like drug stores often sell rubbing ethanol and while using it as rubbing alcohol is not particularly good for you as it can be absorbed through the skin and possibly make you drunk, it is fine for surfaces. Spray it on, wait several minutes, wipe off the excess, and allow the surface to air dry. Do NOT drink it. They add a second, poisonous alcohol in small quantities to denature Oxidizing agents, particularly bleach. Household bleach can be diluted 19 with water to make the socalled 10 solution you sanitize with. Since the household bleach is usually 6.25 by weight the 10 only means it's one tenth as concentrated as household bleach. The chlorine in the solution does evaporate over time, so it loses potency as it gets older. So mix only a little at a time. The bleach that evaporates reacts with air and becomes nontoxic, so once the surface dries it cannot contaminate food. So, while not natural, 10 bleach is safe, effective, and cheap. Use it in the same way as described above for the alcohol. In my town, a gallon of household bleach costs about the same as a pint of 70 isopropanol and a little less than a pint of 79 ethanol. So, I'm using bleach for surface sanitizing, but using isopropanol to mix up homemade hand sanitizer using a recipe I found in the CDC website several months ago. Hand sanitizer should NOT use bleach, as it is too hard on the skin. If facts, after sanitizing surfaces with bleach, you should always rinse and dry your hands. Vinegar, citric acid solutions, household ammonia solutions and many other so called natural disinfectants have been shown to NOT be effective against covid19. So stick with the ones the medical experts say will definitely work soap and water for hands, clothes, and other cloth. Alcohol, 60 or more by volume, for hand sanitizers, and wet ones so not alcohol free baby wipes, they don't disinfect, and 10 bleach for surfaces that won't have the color fade.

In general, one should avoid mixing household cleaning preparations with other preparations, in case there are conflicting ingredients that wont play nice with each other. You can safely dilute the bleach with water 1 part to 20 or 30 parts water, and use it as a disinfectant after washing your hands, by dipping your hands in it or saturating your hands with it somehow, rinsing, and drying thoroughly. My household disinfectant preparation is about a tablespoon to an ounce of household bleach added to an empty spray bottle, then filled with water holds about 25 ounces. This is still enough bleach to lighten coffee stains, so it is certainly enough bleach to disinfect. I spray, saturating the surfaces fully, let stand about 5 minutes, then wipe it up. If the surface will have food placed directly on it plastic cutting boards, etc., I rinse and allow to air dry. However, I think it might be possible to mix bleach with hand wash, or even liquid soap.
