Thank you for this question, Rose Anne. Prince Harry seems to be waging war on just about everything. Get him on social media or on camera and he begins yammering away about ‘systemic racism’ and that host of other, nouveau terms with racism attached. He loses me and quite frankly, does he mumble now? I cannot understand him. Harry now includes himself and his wifey in being SJWs, Social (In)justice Warriors. Harry’s social injustice was showing before Markle, when he was in the army and called one of his fellow soldiers the N-word. Great, Harry. I am able to make out that he is angry at social media for being hypocritical and allowing people to go on undisturbed, for disparaging others. I, for one, become incandescent with rage at the thought of Harry and Markle disrespecting Her Majesty. Enough said.
