What I think is that Republicans, including Trump, have  said, repeatedly , that we are shocked and disgusted by George Floyd’s death, and we support changes in the way chokeholds are used in every police department. However, the riots are equally abhorrent, in the loss of lives, the looting and arson and the destruction of places where people live and where they’ve invested their life savings to build a business. The riots, organized by ANTIFA and paid for by George Soros should be between the people who are angry at the way the police behave, and the city managers of the cities they live in. Instead, a man who has said that he wants to see the United States destroyed and who wants to see a revolution here, has mobilized agitators to encourage riots, has supplied them with weapons, and who has paid people to use them against  us! I despise the people who have let this evil into our country, and I would never trust anyone who would “bend a knee”. Americans never “bend a knee”, except to God — and these protestors are not God. I also completely reject the Leftist idea of “systemic” racism, nor do I believe that I, or anyone else I know, is racist. I think that racism is actually fairly rare in this country, and it is gradually becoming rarer. I think that living in a world where you actually believe in systemic racism would be terribly sad. If you do, I pity you.
