Hypocrisy. I had answered a similar question once, but this trait seems to be a feature of the conservative brand today. Let's take a trip down memory lane. Most of you might remember this peach of a woman: Miss Kim Davis, refused to issue marriage licenses to same sex couples which was required by law. A form of protest at her workplace for her beliefs against the law of the land. Conservative reaction? SHE IS A HERO! She stood up for what she believesâ€‹ in. This is America. If we weren't allowed to voice our opinions and thoughts and blindly adhere to the government mechanisms, we'd be living in a tyrrany! FREEDOM FOR THE WIN! Now, explain to me the difference between that protest of Ms. Davis, and this protest: The athletes taking the knee are not disrupting anything, not rioting, not marching on the streets because right wing pundits call that 'A form of violence', not even refusing to do their work, which is to play the sport. They are not protesting the flag or the anthem, they are protesting injustices and systemic racism  through  them. If this is also a wrong way to protest, then what exactly is the right way to do it? Again, they are protesting the fact that the flag and the anthem is not representing the things it's supposed to represent.
