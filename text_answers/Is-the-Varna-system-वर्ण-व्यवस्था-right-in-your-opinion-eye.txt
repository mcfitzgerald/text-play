According to my perspective, Yes, the Varna system is right. For beginners, Varna, a Sanskrit word with several meanings including type, order, colour, class or division of humans depending on the work they do, was used to refer to social classes. These and other Hindu texts classified the society in principle into four varnas: Now, I would ask you, why is there racism in our modern society? Why are White people considered superior to Black people by the society? Why can't we the society consider them equal? Yes, that is the problem here. In the Treta Yuga and Dwapar Yuga, there was no discrimination, no racism. Everyone was considered equal. The shudras though, we're considered inferior by some people and kings. Now, some people may tell that dividing people is not correct. But this type of division, i.e. the Varna system, is division based on work and what work should be carried out by whom. So, in the end, if discrimination and racism does not exist, then the Varna system is perfect and at the end of the day, All of us are humans. And also to know: “VARNA SYSTEM IS NOT CASTE SYSTEM”.
