Because Ben Shapiro’s brand is a contradiction. He presents himself as the intellectual conservative whose logic and reasoning is deftly wielded to own the Libs. The issue is that many, many of the things he says are either cherry-picked, misrepresented, fallacious, straight-up wrong, or some combination of these. For example, in this clip, the original version of which has 206,000 views on YouTube and many hundreds of thousands more in the various “Ben Shapiro destroys leftists” YouTube compilations it’s included in, Ben asks a student who confronts him about institutional racism to, “name an institution that is racist.” Ben Shapiro Takes on Institutional Racism and White Privilege   The college student taking part in a Q&A that he is ‘debating’ here appeared to be unprepared for this response and couldn’t give much of an answer. Which, is exactly why he only debates unprepared college students in his audience. Ben Shapiro is a professional orator, he does this everyday, all day, as opposed to his debate opponents who usually don’t do this at all. In that context, of course it will always look like he’s the winner. But if instead of being a college student, this had been an expert, they would’ve been able to tell Ben Shapiro about the bias inherent to policing, the criminal justice system, healthcare, education, or more. Or they would’ve have been able to tell him how the institution at question when people talk about institutional racism  is racism. He only debates college students because he lies all the time and relies on his opponent not being as prepared as he is.
