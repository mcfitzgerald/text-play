If I do something systematically I do it methodically, in an organized, deliberate way. It’s precise and thorough. Systemic is entirely different - it means it is indivisible from the whole, ingrained, inseparable, intrinsic. Even when you are being systematic, you can’t fix racism if it’s systemic. Because systemic means it’s not that there is something wrong with the system. It means it is the system.
