I think he is essentially correct. If the system is geared to give privileges to whites, how come Asians in this country do so well…in fact, better than whites themselves? So maybe it’s NOT skin color that determines your destiny in America. There are so many things that could be classified as privileges like wealth, health, age, and the culture in which you live that can explain why things are as they are. As he stated, to lump a group of people and say this is how all people of this group are, is the direct road to racism. Each person is special and unique, built in with their own privileges. To ignore your own privileges and to link your success or failure to other’s supposed privileges is a cop out.
