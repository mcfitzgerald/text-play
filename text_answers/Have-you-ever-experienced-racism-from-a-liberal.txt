Any time I've heard: “Only white people can be racist.” “Enjoy your white privilege.” “Racism is in a white person's DNA. “ “Blacks have a right to loot and vandalize because of systemic inequities your people caused.” “You don't get to weigh in. You're a white male.” All of those statements are racist.
