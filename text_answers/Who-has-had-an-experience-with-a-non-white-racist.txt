I do, often. Especially as of late. The following conversation is one I had with  drumroll  someone on YouTube. I posted a comment on a video about 10 things black people demand from white people, something along those lines. Me: I find this whole thing ridiculous. You're telling white people who inherit homes to give them up supposedly because black people cant work to earn one on their own. Isn't that racism itself? YouTuber: No it's not racism!! Thanks to slavery and Jim Crow, black people are at a disadvantage. Ever heard of systemic racism??!! Me: Yes I have and I have yet to see an example of systemic racism in modern day America. YouTuber: Nigga you don't know shit! Don't you know about discrimination against black people getting houses back then?? RED LINING???!!! Me: Yes I have and that happened decades ago and once red lining stopped, there was a program that just gave home loans away that weren't required to be paid back and it failed miserably. (I forget the name of the program) YouTuber: Bruh, you ain't nothin but a sell out ass house nigga! You a mothafuckin traitor to your race and you need to be murked, fuck you! I tried my best to lower my grammar down to the level of the person, but it was actually pretty hard. So yeah. Every race has their bad bunch but in my entire life, the ONLY race I've ever experienced any racism from period, is black people. Black people seem to really hate me.
