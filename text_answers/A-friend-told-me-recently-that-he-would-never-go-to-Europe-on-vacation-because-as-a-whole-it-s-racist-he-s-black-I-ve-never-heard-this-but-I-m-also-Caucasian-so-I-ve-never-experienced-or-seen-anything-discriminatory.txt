I'm black. I've traveled Europe pretty extensively, along with two of my other black friends. We've traveled to Croatia, Hungary, Germany, U.K and many other places. Europe varies a lot, it's impossible to generalize racism like that. But it definitely exists, however in a different form than North America. North America tends to have more “malicious” racism, probably due to the history of slavery here. It's often deliberate and systemic. Europe is different. Places like Croatia that have very few black tourists or citizens might seem “racist” at first glance to a black person. Weird stares. Pointing. Laughing. Whispering. Asking to touch your hair or skin. However at a closer look, you realize it's actually just ignorance. Not coming from a place of maliciousness; they just haven't had any experience with black people! It's a great opportunity to spread good will in communities that aren't familiar with us. The way you interact with locals can reverberate through the country forever. EDIT: I've gotten a bunch of messages from people asking for details on my travels as a black guy. I'm Canadian, and I've been fortunate enough to have been to nearly every inhabited continent except for South America (the next big adventure). My favorite place is Melbourne, Australia. I lived there for 6 months, then went and traveled throughout Asia. I'm probably going to answer more questions like these in the future due to the interest, so if you're interested in learning and trading travel stories, feel free to follow me! I'm also moving to London early next year. If anyone cool would like to connect, let me know.
