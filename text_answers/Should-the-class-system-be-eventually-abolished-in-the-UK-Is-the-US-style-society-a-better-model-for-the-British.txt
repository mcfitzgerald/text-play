Consider first the beam in your own eye. The US should abolish racism before it comes after the UK for the class system. Like the US race system, the UK class system has no organisation running, no laws that enforce it. In fact, like racism, there are laws against it, that don’t always work. The US has more of a class system than the UK. But it is based on a combination of race, religion and money, as opposed to the UK’s very weak ancestry based one. when a gay black atheist whose unmarried parents were share croppers has the same opportunity as a straight white member of a “good” church whose parents were Ivy League, I will admit that the US has no class system.
