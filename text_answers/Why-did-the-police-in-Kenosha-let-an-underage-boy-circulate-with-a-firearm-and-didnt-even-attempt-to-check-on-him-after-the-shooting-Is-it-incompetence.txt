Incompetence, yes, but more so, blatant racism. When they asked for 200 National Guards to be brought in because they were afraid and unable to deal with a legal protest over their incompetence and racism, that was further incompetence. When they refused to investigate gun fire in the night or ask the guard to look into it, that was incompetence tinged with racism. When they were preferential to “militias” over the diverse National Guard, that was racism tinted with incompetence. When they treated black and white participants in the deadly event so differently, that was just plain racism. The Kenosha police cover the whole spectrum of gross incompetence (itself a side effect of white privilege in this case) and deadly, systemic racism, with special immunity. Extra points for a chief that goes straight to victim blaming. I bet next, their union will demand a raise.
