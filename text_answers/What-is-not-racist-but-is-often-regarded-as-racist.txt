Being critical of racist systems is a big one.  A lot of Americans, for example,  still  hate Michelle Obama because she said she hadn't felt proud of the country in many years.  When a rich, white Republican talks about how the United States has declined (in...some way...they never really explain what metrics they're using), they get praise.  An African-American woman who's not excited about a country that treats people a lot like her very poorly, she clearly hates white people, apparently. Trying to fix systemic racism is another.  Affirmative action (another U.S. example, obviously) requires giving candidates a fair chance, even when they're in classes that traditionally face discrimination.  Yet, it's constantly under attack for holding minorities to "lower standards," harming them by giving them a chance at a good education, and taking spots that "should have" gone to white people . Disliking a specific person of a particular race is the last I'll talk about.  You can a shocking number of questions of Quora bemoaning the racist white women for not dating [choose one of Latinos, African-Americans, Asians, or South Asians], by which they mean  them , and plenty of counterpart questions asking what's wrong with white women that they're out dating minorities instead of keeping to their own.  While I can't discount that some racism might be involved in a particular incident, the more obvious explanation is that people might not want partners who are obsessed with the racial breakdown of who another group dates and that disliking you doesn't necessarily mean hating what you are...
