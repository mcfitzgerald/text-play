As a conservative what do you think about this article "Dear white people your dictionary definition of racism is wrong?" Dear White People, Your "Dictionary Definition" of Racism is Wrong   Well, if the title of the article itself didn’t tell me all I needed to know, this gem right here sealed the deal. Racism is not “systemic”. We actually have a phrase to describe systemic racism. It’s “systemic racism”. From  One would think that the definition of racism were simple. If we consult the Oxford English Dictionary, racism is defined as This seems pretty straightforward. If you believe one race is intrinsically superior or inferior to others, that is racism. If you believe that all members of a race share intrinsic characteristics, that is also racism. So the belief by the Nazis that the Aryan race was superior to all others is clearly racist. As is the belief that all Mexicans are lazy. Even the idea that all Asians are good at math is racist. This common definition of racism has been in use since 1902, when it replaced the earlier terms “racialism” [1]. This lexical definition is the one that most English speakers are familiar with, and the one that they use. Prejudice plus Power A new and pervasive mis-definition of racism in use today is that racism is prejudice  plus  power. This new  stipulative  definition was coined by Patricia Bidol in 1972 [2],  Developing New Perspectives on Race: An Innovative Multi-media Social Studies Curriculum in Racism Awareness for the Secondary Level. This definition, which appears to have been a technical definition of use when discussing sociology in a specific, limited context, has escaped academia and is now used in some circles as the sole definition of racism. This has led to the ridiculous, and ironically racist, idea that only white people can be racist, but one cannot racist  against  white people. “Racism is prejudice plus power. On the basis of this definition, while all people can be prejudiced, only those who have power are really racist. African Americans, Latinos, Asians and American Indians, the powerless in American society, can be and often are most prejudiced toward Whites on an individual basis, but they are not racists at the structural, institutional level. Within this understanding of racism, to be a racist you have to possess two things: 1) socioeconomic power to force others to do what you desire even if they don't want to, and 2), the justification of this power abuse by an ideology of biological supremacy. Keep in mind that what often is described as racism in society today, is really nothing more than prejudice and discrimination. While a Black or Latino person, through the use of a gun and/or intimidation, can force a White person to do as he, as an individual, desires, this is an individual act of aggression, not a socially structured power arrangement. At present, however, only Whites have that kind of power, reinforced by a belief in an ideology of supremacy, both of which constitute the basis of racism in America today.” [3] By this strained and abused concept of racism, I’m left wondering, if I were to kidnap the Grand High Putz of the Klu Klux Klan, and drop him off in say, Kenya or China, would he still be racist? By the definition of prejudice plus power, no, he wouldn’t. For myself, I believe that he’d still be racist no matter where he is, due to his beliefs, not his power or lack thereof. Racism as prejudice plus power is a very narrow definition that is highly technical and applicable to a certain study of sociology. In that narrow context, the definition works, as a study of societies as a whole. However, the term is blatantly misused now to describe individuals. The problem here is the difference between theory in the scientific sense and theory in the general sense. Most people only know one definition, and don’t understand when it’s misused in a different context. Further, many of the very people who purport to be fighting racism are profoundly racist themselves against even people who are  not  white. The obsession with labels and cultural appropriation forces people into a very narrow path based on nothing more than their race and native culture. Frankly, in addition to be incredibly oppressive it shows a blinding ignorance of other cultures. References 1. Oxford English Dictionary 2.  https://books.google.co.uk/books...   3.

Furthermore, I have yet to read anything titled “Dear White People…” that isn’t itself racist. It’s a naked excuse for non-white folk to be racist bigots, but excuse their behavior as somehow not exactly what it is. The ironic part is, it is itself racist, no matter who it comes from. If it’s brown people making the claim, it’s racist and abusive gaslighting. “No, I’m not the racist, you are!”. From white people, it’s the soft bigotry of low-expectations. Evidently brown people aren't civilized enough to be held to the same standard as white people, and so get a free pass on being racist. Look, either you’re equal and held to the same standards as everyone, or you’re not.
