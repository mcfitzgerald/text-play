He is out of touch, he’s done nothing to point to as his history as an incumbent, and he’s just plain gross. He lies, he blusters, he carries on about how much he loves America, but he’s full of shW#$^t. He does NOT care about us. He has done NOTHING about health care, NOTHING about the systemic racism and resulting violence in this country, NOTHING about anything except looting the system for himself and his family. It is truly appalling.
