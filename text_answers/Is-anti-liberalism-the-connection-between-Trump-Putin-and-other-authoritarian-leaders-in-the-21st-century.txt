Yes. When humans begin to outgrow a primitive, animal system, in favor of a more modern, efficient and evolutionarily favorable system, the old way has a â€˜last hurrah' before it dies. First we challenge it, it resists, then we show defeat is inevitable, it has a last hurrah, then the next push makes it go extinct. Tyranny is popular with tyrants, but humanity is outgrowing it. Expect pushback from the few with so much to lose, in the final throes. Like racism, sexism, inherited wealth and privilege.
