Quite nicely. I personally never had any bad experience with police in the America. But I also understand that’s largely due to My relatively benign experience is NOT counter-evidence against systemic racism in the police force. The thing is, the majority of people do not experience police brutality. But then again, “do not beat up or kill innocent people” is the bare minimum for any citizen, let alone a police officer, who should, you know, “protect and serve”. OK, say, water. we all drink them, the city provides it, we pay for the water pipes and such with our tax money. But occasionally, some people get serious sickness and die because of bacteria in water. Do you think it is reasonable to say “well, the majority of people have no problem with water, I don’t know why this city’s water services get a bad rap just because a few people died because of drinking water? I don’t understand why are people so angry. So a few of them got seriously ill and died because water service people aren’t careful. And a few of them got seriously ill and died because some water service employees literally poison the water… I have been drinking from the faucet all my life, never had any problem at all.” Your personal experience does not negate systemic problems. And YOU putting your personal experience out there and defend an oppressive system, that makes you part of the problem. You’re basically saying “because I don’t feel oppressed, it does not exist”. You know what that called? It’s called privilege. Yes yes, you’re black, you’re brown, you’re male, you fit the profile. Never experience racism, ever. What is racism, LOL? You got lucky. It’s like those white women who believe they don’t need feminism. Great, I really hope all you “oppression doesn’t exist because it doesn’t impact me” people continue to be lucky.
