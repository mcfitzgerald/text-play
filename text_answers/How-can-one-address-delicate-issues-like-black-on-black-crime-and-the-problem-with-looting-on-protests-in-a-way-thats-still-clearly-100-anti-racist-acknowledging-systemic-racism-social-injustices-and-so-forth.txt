Hahahaha “How can I be a racist asshat while pretending to not be a racists asshat?” “Black on black crime” is not a “delicate issue”, it’s flat-out racist asswipe. If you could read, you’d know that  all  crime is primarily personal and local. In fact, shocker, there’s more “white on white crime” than “black on black crime”. But I guess that does not matter because handwavy-handwavy. “Looting on protests” is a crime. We address that “delicate issue” by arresting and charging people who commit the crime, and then trying them. It’s pretty simple, really.
