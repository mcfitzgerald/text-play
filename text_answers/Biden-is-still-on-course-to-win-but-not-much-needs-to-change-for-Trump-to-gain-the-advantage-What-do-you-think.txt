Funny how so many people answering disable comments. Kinda like the way they approach a crisis. I know all I need to know, I don’t need to listen to you. Like their stupid leader who hasn’t ONCE even addressed the fact that we have a systemic racism problem in this country. Because he’s stupid, scared and racist.
