Warning— This answer would be somewhat unconventional and uncomfortable. This   is, an often ignored example of Systemic racism. This bar-chart presents a demographics of gay men in USA. The discrepancy can  not  be ignored. There’s no biological theory that suggests black men are less likely to be gay. It is only natural that at least 10–12% of all gay men would be, ethnically black (given the fact US has 13% black population). But the statistics do  not  match that expectation. Why? The reason is purely social. Black men are less likely to come out. Black gay men are less likely to accept themselves. As a broader community, African-americans enjoy less exposure and less opportunities towards societal liberation and enlightenment. There’s a reason — why DL culture  is prevalent in the African-American communities. This ‘lack of liberation/enlightenment’ on a broader ‘community-level’, due to societal factors perpetuate into sexual practices and access to relevant healthcare. It imposes additional dangers to men of color. That is precisely why, despite being a statistical minority, African americans are significantly more affected by HIV. Statistically, black men are more than 10 times more likely  to be infected by HIV. Moral of the story — Systemic racism exists, and it hurts in more ways than we can imagine.
