Such answers are not actually that hard to find if you are sincere about looking. Yes, of course all lives matter. But here’s the thing:  the law enforcement and criminal justice systems act as if black lives matter less than white lives.  Not in every case, and not in every jurisdiction, but far too often. When people protest by saying that “black lives matter” they aren’t saying that the lives of white people don’t matter.  Nobody is saying that.  What they are calling attention to is that systemic racism is a serious problem that harms black and minority communities. When people stand up to BLM and say, “no,  all lives matter”  what they are saying is that “you aren’t experiencing any problems which are unique” when in fact, they are. One in fifteen African American men are incarcerated, compared to one in 106 white men. According to the Bureau of Justice, one in three black men will be imprisoned in their lifetime. Black motorists are three times more likely to be searched during traffic stops. Police are four times as likely to use force during encounters with African Americans. The “war on drugs” is largely waged in black and minority communities. When arrested as minors, black youth are more likely to be tried as adults and sent to adult prisons than white kids of the same age. Statistics show that black offenders receive longer sentences and more often are subject to mandatory minimum sentences, and are sentenced to prison terms at disproportionately high rates. Yes, all lives matter. But let’s not pretend that the real issues of systemic racism that affect minority communities and the way that they interact with police and the justice system aren’t significant or real.
