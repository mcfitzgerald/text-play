It is the effect of having not one single person of color on a creative team. I can see the room now, filled with white faces all thinking of their own children, who they call monkey all the time, no one of them aware of racial discrimination because they have a black friend you know. No one older who isn’t also kind-of-racist, so no one in the in the company, the agency, the printer who says, “uh, folks, this is racist.” I worked in advertising. I guarantee this happened. And I guarantee if someone did, they were told, “No, it’s cute. Leave it.” Racism is systemic. They may have no active intent to offend, but because the system they live in perpetuates colonialist thinking  while simultaneously erasing all evidence  that this issue had been a problem previously and had been dealt with by previous generations, they become racist.
