I have lived in Australia, Canada and the U.S. 1. Immigration laws are as follows: 2. Cultural acceptance: The most selective country is Australia, They have a tough immigration system, and a tougher screening process. No tom dick and harry can enter Australia. They are good with breaking down the immigration population and bringing in the most talented ones to the country.
