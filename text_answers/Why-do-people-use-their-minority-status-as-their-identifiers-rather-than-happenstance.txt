You must be asking this because you are white. Let’s do a thought experiment. Imagine that you are black, not just black, but African. You’ve lived most of your life in the country of your birth. The vast majority of people around you are of your race. Your race, for you, is about as consequential as the fact that you have two elbows. It’s just something you can take for granted. You’re not going to have run-ins with the criminal justice system because you look suspicious to a police officer. You will be aware of your race, because you will have learned about colonization, and because most of the movies you watch will have White actors, but day-to-day, your race won’t be meaningful to you. Imagine that you move to a country where blacks constitute a minority of the population. Initially, you might still not want to think about race. You will keep your own mindset and decide that race is about complexion and nothing more. But soon, you will notice a couple of things: The result of this will be that even if you don’t start out that way, you will end up with a very acute sense of your blackness. Talking about racism is a very thankless task. This is why my forays into discussions about race are few and far between. I also feel that I am doing more for perceptions of blacks by talking about topics like medicine, healthcare policy, politics, and history than I would if a greater proportion of my content were about race. But very few blacks in the US have the luxury of not thinking about their race.
