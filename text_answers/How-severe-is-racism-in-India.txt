There are two different things being discussed here. The behavior of the people wrt to the Sudanese guy can be attributed majorly to curiosity. Anything that's out of place grabs human attention. That is our nature. Maybe, even I would look back again if I find a 6"5' black guy roaming on the streets of Pune! For the simple reason that you don't seen them around very often. However, as far as the question of India being a racist country is concerned, answer to that would be a resounding  YES . Maybe, 'our racism' is a bit different from the western concept, but it does exist in the form of deeply entrenched caste system, stereotypes and prejudices in our society. So, we not only have castes, we have sub-castes too (gotras). We have Dalits, the Harijans, Brahmins, Baniyas and what not. To make matters more complicated, we have further preconceived notions based on the place a person comes from. So, while Northies look down upon the 'Madrasi' way of eating rice by hands, the Southerners probably think that the Northies are only good enough for the Bhangra. The Bengalis are supposed to be intellectuals, and every half-decent Bihari is supposed to crack IAS. There are the 'Chinkis' from the north-east, and the 'Bhaiyyas' from UP.  And then we have the national obsession for the  whiter  skin. From 'Fair and Lovely' to matrimonial ads in the daily newspaper - its all indicative of our bias for the 'fairer complexion'. And of course, then there is religion. We are practising racism in just too many ways! We might not say it or admit it, but ultimately its what we do that defines us.
