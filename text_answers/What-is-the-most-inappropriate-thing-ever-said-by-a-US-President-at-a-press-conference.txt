Just when I thought Trump couldn’t sink any lower, last Friday happened. CHIP SOMODEVILLA / GETTY IMAGES When PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump about his plan to address racial inequality, the president pressed his fingers to his lips and said “shhh.” Pretty much every press conference Trump holds is an opportunity for him to show how classless, base, self-aggrandizing and out of touch with reality he is. He tells reporters to shut up, be quiet, they are “bad reporters” and they should be ashamed of themselves.  He calls them “fake news”. But to shh someone? Especially a black reporter asking about systemic racism in the middle of riots and protests? How fucking patronizing can he be? And he followed that up by declaring George Floyd is looking down from heaven and is “happy” to see job counts increase. I don’t think he could have said anything worse if he tried. Every press conference shows just how wrong it is to have this failed businessman as our President. He wouldn’t know how to lead a Sunday school class, let alone an entire nation. He’s not funny. His diction is horrible. He can’t read off a teleprompter. He has no charisma. Someone needs to tell him he can’t be on camera anymore. Shh. With finger to his lips. What an asshole. But, today’s a new day. I’m sure he can beat that show of depravity with something worse if we just give him a chance.
