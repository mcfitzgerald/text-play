In the mother of all ironies, Jack Merritt, one of the two people who were killed by the Islamic terrorist Usman Khan during the London Bridge knife attack was a Social Justice Warrior who supported the unfettered Islamic migration into the UK and was against the supposed "systemic racism, bigotry & Islamophobia in western society. He had also recently graduated from Cambridge University after submitting a thesis on the 'Over-Representation of Black, Asian & Minority Ethnic males in British Prisons' and supported early release of criminals from the prison (Usman Khan was released within 6 yrs of his 16 yr sentence).
