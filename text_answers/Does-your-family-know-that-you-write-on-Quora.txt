My little sister does. She’s been disappointed in some of my writings. I care about income inequality and systematic racism at every level of the criminal “justice” system. But I have a hard time getting very worked up about what I consider the cosmetics of racism. She’s more militantly Black than I will ever be. If   were describing her, he would say that she was more of a Marxist identitarian than I am. I just shrug.
