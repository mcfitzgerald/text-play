Sure. Just adopt a national biometric ID database, based on lessons learned by India with its Aadhaar system. It would have to be free and administered federally, nationwide, and then all states could adopt it as a nothing-else-needed voter ID. Of course all right wingers would oppose this in a hot fury. One, because as representing the Confederacy 2.0, they’re totally paranoid about the federal government. Two, they know there’s no significant voter fraud, and this would remove the fig leaf covering the depth of their racism and bias against all things liberal.
