Barack Obama Barack Obama, whilst not in office anymore, was without a doubt the most overrated world leader of the modern era whose only real defining feature was being the first black president. He failed to make a real effect on social change in society and racism in America is more rampant. Obamacare failed to live up to its promises though I admit this isn’t entirely his fault. He was responsible for civilian deaths in the Middle East by drone strikes. Economic growth was slow and he failed to address the economic failures of modern America. He didn’t significantly tackle climate change nor poverty in America. He didn’t do anything about solving massive corporate cronyism in the American political system. He was underwhelming to say the least and didn’t do anything to stop the decline of American politics and society into a fractured society.
