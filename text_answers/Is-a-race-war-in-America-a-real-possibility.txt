Hardly. Racism the way it is being presented is a hoax. Systemic racism is a thing of the past. Yes, blacks and whites are killed committing crimes and resisting arrest. We just had two police officers nearly assassinated in their patrol car by a black man. Now if we had systemic racism police would be rounding up and arresting every black criminal they could. They would be beating them senseless too. Even when protesters were blocking the injured officers from getting medical help, the cops didn’t lose their cool. George Floyd was high as a kite and resisting arrest. There is zero evidence that it was racially motivated and it now looks as if the fentanyl in his system may have killed him. He was also complaining of not being able to breathe before he was ever on the ground. Hands up, dont shoot never happened. Michael Brown attacked a police officer and went back for a second attack when he was shot, multiple witnesses have testified. Eric Gardner had health problems and resisted arrest. His situation was not racially motivated either. He made a mistake by not being compliant and because of his health problems and being overweight, wrestling with police proved fatal. Starting to get the idea? These stories have been presented in a factually inaccurate manner in an effort to make them about race when they aren’t. People are catching on to the games the media is playing and how they have lost all integrity they once had in presenting the news in an unbiased fashion. This is why they have earned the nickname “fake news,” which has stuck!
