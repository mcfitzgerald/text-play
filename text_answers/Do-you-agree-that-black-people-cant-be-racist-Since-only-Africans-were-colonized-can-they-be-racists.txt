No. Not only do I disagree; I actually find this extremely insulting. I’m not your noble savage; I am an individual with a sense of agency. My race is not deterministic of my behavior. There are white people I have power over. I could discriminate against them to favor blacks; I don’t. And it’s not because I’m incapable of being racist or feeling racial resentment. But, but , I hear you say,  racism only means systemic racism. And black people don’t have the power to enact systemic racism against others. So, however you define it, black people can exhibit racism.
