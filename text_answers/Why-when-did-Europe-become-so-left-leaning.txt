Why did Europe become so leftist and liberal? It isnâ€™t. Much of Europe at the moment is experiencing a movement towards centre-right politics. I assume you mean in comparison to the USA. This is because the USA is ultraconservative. Things like LGBT rights, anti-racism, free healthcare, and welfare systems are largely supported by the centre right in Europe. One of the problems with comparisons is that the Republican party of today would be thought of as extreme in Europe.
