They come with a free carrying strap that can be used as a stretching band for advanced postures. These mats can safely be considered as a single time investment due to their high durability and premium quality.\\\\n\\\\nAdrenex: Adrenex is a sports fitness brand by Flipkart. These mats are good enough to keep your balance during any yoga posture. They are anti skid and thus prevent any kind of injuries. They are made up of good quality EVA foam and you don\\\\u2019t have to dig deep into your pockets to own one of these mats. These mats last enough to get your money back.\\\\n\\\\nQuickShel: These are PVC yoga mats that are comparatively light weight and fairly inexpensive. Their sticky surface gives you a good grip and balance while performing various asanas. However, the downside is that these mats cannot be recycled or biodegraded. If you have just started out as a beginner yogi who wants to go for an economical mat, these can be considered as a good value for money.\\\\n\\\\nAmazon Basics : The Amazon Basics mat can be used for various exercises and yoga workouts. It is a basic mat that has no decorations and features a variety of colours. Some of their mats are better than Adrenex while others are of similar stuff.

Also, some poses like lotus it may be more difficult to cross your legs with shoes on.

I\\\\u2019ve heard teachers use the metaphor \\\\u201celephant foot\\\\u201d to describe balancing the body weight equally on the standing foot in balancing postures.

As it happens, yoga students with flat feel have difficulty balancing in the one-legged postures.\\\\n\\\\nNoticing this in my early days as a teacher I suggested to a student with flat feet to consciously pull an arch into the standing foot. The student had much difficulty following that suggestion at first. But over time he was able to develop the muscles necessary to create an arch in his flat feet during postures. His balance improved. Eventually his falling arches improved as well. My yoga cured his falling arches. I\\\\u2019ve repeated this scenario a few times over the years too.

If they didn\\\\u2019t have metallurgy, where did they get all the gold that Cortez wanted? Aztecs and other Mesoamerican groups smelted copper, silver and gold, as well as bronze and alloys of the above materials. Iron was known, but in the Old World, the smelting of iron was probably an accident. A theory for how iron smelting was discovered in the Old World is that some iron ore was used as the walls of a pottery kiln. The kiln got hot enough to smelt the iron. This or something similar never happened in Mesoamerica. The Aztecs would have no reason to believe that iron was even capable of being smelted, as none of the kilns or furnaces they used got to temperatures hot enough for that.\\\\n\\\\nNow then, of the metals the Aztecs could smelt, only bronze and (sort of ) copper were practical for weapons. Here\\\\u2019s the thing though, obsidian and chert flint are better for cutting, a heck of a lot cheaper and just generally more readily available. It was a lot more practical for a warrior to carry around glue and extra obsidian blades than to have an expensive bronze axe or spear that didn\\\\u2019t even cut as well as an obsidian one. Now, they did use bronze axes for chopping down trees, and these saw military use occasionally, and bronze maces like the Quauhol\\\\u014dlli. They also used rhombus shaped bronze arrowheads against the joints of Spanish armor, and were capable of casting lead for sling bullets.\\\\n\\\\nSo basically, the very premise of this question is false. The Aztecs did use metal weapons. And the underlying sentiment, that Aztecs were inferior for not using metal weapons (which again, they did) is also false.

It doesn\\\\u2019t really matter what kind of business it is, the fundamentals stay the same. Here are a few ideas to get the juices flowing (apologies if they seem a little haphazard):\\\\n\\\\n * Develop systems that ensure every job your business does is thorough and is done with a high level of care. People will notice you or your staff placing breakables of small objects out of harm\\\\u2019s way before starting, for example. And make sure you don\\\\u2019t miss any out of the way corners or difficult to reach surfaces.\\\\n * Distinguish yourself by researching products and techniques that will demonstrate that you know your \\\\u201ccraft\\\\u201d. This may be things like environmentally (and especially pet) friendly cleaning fluids, naturally sourced, non-scratch cloths, tools to easily reach difficult to reach surfaces etc. It may require extra investment, but all you need is one or two customers to notice and the word will get around.\\\\n * Try to come up with \\\\u201clittle extras\\\\u201d that can really set you apart. I am thinking of something like leaving a few quality chocolates with a hand-written thank you card on a table once the job is done. It\\\\u2019s amazing what a little extra effort will do for your reputation.\\\\n * Make sure that every customer is treated very well and anticipate really picky, pedantic customers. Your happy customers will be your best marketing channel.\\\\n * Follow up after the job to get feedback on the customer\\\\u2019s experience. Deal with negative feedback quickly and efficiently.\\\\n * If you have people working for you, look after them well. They are the face of your business and their attitude, work ethic and thoughtfulness will make or break your business. They need to be (comparatively) well paid, motivated, trained and, most importantly, must feel as though they have a stake in the success of the business that is more than just a paycheck at the end of the week.\\\\n * Like any business, watch your cash flow, borrow as little as possible and manage your resources well. No matter how well you\\\\u2019re doing on the front line, if the business itself is not well run, it\\\\u2019s a sinking ship. In a business like this, make sure you have insurance to cover damage to customer possessions. Breaking an expensive vase could land you in hot water and could sink your business.\\\\n * I would advise against competing against competitors on price - it\\\\u2019s a zero sum game. Focus more on a premium (but still affordable) service by doing everything better than most of your competition.\\\\n * Make sure you are online (with a website) and encourage people to rate your service on sites like Yelp. If you get a bad review deal with it in a professional way. Your competitors will most probably try to slag you off by submitting false negative reviews, especially if you take business away from them, but every negative review is an opportunity to show how you can handle bad situations, which will actually help you in the long run.\\\\n * Just a final thought; I am not sure if this is actually something being offered by cleaning companies but perhaps you can offer a service where people can phone you for emergency cleanups where, for example, their kids have spilled a box of cereal all over the kitchen floor or have smeared jelly all over the walls. They can contact you and you can send someone out to clean the mess up (and it could have a catchy name). It would need to be carefully costed so it\\\\u2019s not ludicrously expensive, but if well executed, it may be a great way to get your name out there.\\\\nCleaning businesses are a dime a dozen, but most of them are very similar from my limited experience with them. By daring to stand out on one hand and focusing on running a tight ship on the other, there is no reason that you couldn\\\\u2019t build your business into a very successful enterprise.\\\\n\\\\nGood luck with it.\", \"',\n",

Distilled or filtered water may be more effective, and a good several-minute soak can go even further, especially for cutting down on bacteria.\\\\n\\\\n--Soap: Soap isn\\\\u2019t meant for washing food, and it\\\\u2019s not clear how effective it is against pesticides. It could also possibly seep into the produce, making you ingest another non-food chemical on top of the ones you were trying to wash away!\\\\n\\\\n-- Vinegar: The Food Research review found that washing tomatoes in a vinegar solution significantly reduced the residues of six different pesticides, some by as much as 94 percent. Cheap, nontoxic \\\\u2014 what\\\\u2019s not to like? Try filling a spray bottle with one part vinegar to three parts water and keep it next to the sink.\\\\n\\\\n--Baking soda: In October 2017, researchers from the University of Massachusetts published a study in the journal Agricultural and Food Chemistry that said soaking apples in a baking soda and water solution for 12\\\\u201315 minutes can remove almost every trace of pesticides from the fruit\\\\u2019s surface. If you have the time, this one\\\\u2019s a winner for sure.\\\\n\\\\nIt should be mentioned that none of these fixes can remove pesticides that have already seeped into the fruits and vegetables. If you\\\\u2019re really worried (which you probably shouldn\\\\u2019t be), general preparation methods like peeling, cooking, and canning can remove a substantial amount of pesticides throughout the produce. Peeling goes further than washing by removing the layer that the pesticides have reached; cooking and canning works because many pesticides degrade in heat.\\\\n\\\\nA Few Caveats\\\\n\\\\nWhy not just buy organic? you might ask. Contrary to popular belief, organic produce is grown with pesticides, too. The pesticides just can\\\\u2019t be synthetic (and as we\\\\u2019ve mentioned before, whether a chemical is synthesized from scratch or just perfected from a natural source doesn\\\\u2019t say anything about its safety).\\\\n\\\\nBut if you\\\\u2019re still concerned, take a few precautions. Keep a spray bottle of diluted vinegar on hand for quick rinses and baking soda for when you have the time. Peel or cook the fruits and veggies you\\\\u2019re most worried about. But don\\\\u2019t stop eating them. The science is in on that front, and it says that you should eat your fruits and veggies if you want to live a healthy life.\\\\n\\\\nThanks for A2A\\\\n\\\\nSource: Google images\", \"',\n",

However, if a person has a chronic illness or autoimmune condition, then their bodies don\\\\u2019t need the additional burden of having to deal with foreign substances that place a further strain on their health.\\\\n\\\\nAs for the Dirty Dozen list, try to buy organic if at all possible. Substitute other vegetables wherever possible. Take kale, for instance. Some good substitutes would be collards, rapini [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapini ], bok choy, swiss chard, or broccoli.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem with many of the foods on the Dirty Dozen list is that they contain multiple pesticides. While one pesticide might be relatively safe, no one actually knows how a multiplicity of them work synergistically in the human body. The U.S. allows over 80,000 chemicals in all sorts of things from foods to fabrics.

Some are fairly benign. But others are linked to cancer, reproductive and developmental damage, hormone disruption and neurological problems. Among the dangerous varieties are:\\\\n\\\\n * Carbendazim, a hormone-disrupting fungicide that damages the male reproductive system, which was detected on 16 percent of samples. The EU has banned it because of safety concerns.\\\\n * Bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, which was found on more than 29 percent of samples, is an insecticide that the Environmental Protection Agency and California regulators have designated a possible human carcinogen.\\\\n\\\\nPesticides + Poison Gases = Cheap, Year-Round Strawberries [ https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/strawberries.php ]\\\\n\\\\nStill, eating the vegetables and fruits after washing off as much of the pesticides is better than not eating them at all.

       " {'How-much-does-a-car-wash-cost-in-Shoreview\\n-UNANSWERED': {1: ': \"So I am a manager at an automatic wash, so my opinion will be slightly biased.\\\\n\\\\nI have a pretty deep understanding of the chemistry at both the automatic and touchless washes. Lots of people feel that the touchless washes are the way to go since the automatic ones will eventually leave swirls in your paint (which is only partly true but I\\\\u2019ll get to that in a moment). The only problem with the touchless washes is the chemistry. The way they clean cars is completely different. We combine Chemistry and what we call Mechanical Action (the physical brushes). Touchless washes only use Chemistry. Since they don\\\\u2019t have the benefit of Mechanical Action, they have to use significantly harsher chemicals than we do. Over time, this will deteriorate your clear coat, stain the rims, and seemingly bleach out the hard plastic trim pieces on your car.\\\\n\\\\nThe choice between the two also has something to do with the condition of your car when you bring it in. Is it covered in mud? Maybe go with a touchless over an automatic so it doesn\\'t rub the grit into your paint (however, you\\\\u2019d be safe with a Mister automatic\\\\u2026 One of the first chemicals to go on your car is a lubricant, and our first set of brushes are made out of what we call NeoGlide, which is basically just slippery foam. It helps push the dirt off without holding it in the cloth and rubbing it into your paint). Your traditional automatic won\\\\u2019t have these things, so you are going to run into issues if you continually bring your car in covered in mud.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as the add-ons? I swear by them. And I\\\\u2019ll address them one by one (keep in mind that this only applies to Misters).\\\\n\\\\n * The undercarriage wash is more of a rinse than anything else. We couldn\\'t use a full blown pressure washer down there or we\\\\u2019d damage electronics, but it is useful for rinsing off road grime, salt, or mud out from under your car. Having cleaned the tunnel 100\\\\u2019s of times, I can tell you that that is the dirtiest section of the tunnel, just because it removes so much filth from the underside of cars that people don\\'t even know is there.\\\\n * Wheel cleaning comes in all of our packages down to the basic, so I\\\\u2019ll address what we call Wheel Polish (only available in our Platinum, which is the top package). Basically, this is a sacrificial silicone-based polymer layer that is just meant to give your rims a slightly wet look, and it also keeps a layer between your rim and brake dust (which makes it significantly easier to clean. And since every car gets the same attention, it means that you should have immaculately clean wheels every time you come through without needing to touch up certain areas).\\\\n * And finally, my favorite, our wax, the area in which my company has set the standard for the industry. Recognize this?\\\\nWe started this. And yes, this makes a massive difference. One, it\\'s going to shine longer, and two, it\\'s going to give it another sacrificial layer to protect your paint and make it easier to clean next time. On sunny days, you can look down the line of freshly washed cars and see who got wax and who didn\\'t. Its that big of a difference. Also, it makes things like bugs and road tar so much easier to clean off, since those things would be stuck to our wax and not your clear coat.\\\\n\\\\nI said I would get to the problem of swirls in your paint. Our washes mitigate this issue as much as we possibly can, but its part of the wear of the vehicle. Handwashing is worse for it than taking it to a Mister, since at home you probably don\\'t have a cleaning lubricant and NeoGlide brushes to push off the grit before you clean. The issue is the vehicles that only get the wax-less washes every time. Even if you take 3 ply toilet paper and wipe your car in the same spot 1,000\\\\u2019s of times, you\\\\u2019ll start to see marks. The only way to effectively mitigate this completely is to either keep a coat of hand wax on it or to get our wax. Either way, you have to have something between your clear coat and the grit that it encounters every day. I\\\\u2019ll give an anecdote to illustrate:\\\\n\\\\nWe have a regular customer named Mr. Jackson. He\\\\u2019s been coming 3 times a week for six years (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays). He is retired and loves to detail his truck every single time he comes in (the inside, I mean. He lets us take care of the outside). He has a black Ford F150 and gets the wash with the wax every single time he comes in. His paint is in immaculate condition. You\\\\u2019d be hard pressed to find any issues with it anywhere, even though he takes it to one of those \\\\u201chorrible automatic washes that scratch your paint\\\\u201d 3 days out of the week. That\\\\u2019s roughly in the neighborhood of 972 washes without ANY issues. I wish I had pictures of his truck to post, but I won\\'t see him till Saturday.\\\\n\\\\nAnyways, I hope my answer has given you an insight into processes and chemicals behind a car wash. There\\\\u2019s a lot more to it than I think most people realize.\", \"',\n",

If you use a modern touchless wash that drops \\\\u2018wax\\\\u2019 too, there really should be no damage to the finish. My brother in law does his car on the same schedule of every other day, but does not wipe it off. I suspect that his recent driver side power window failure may be linked to this constant washing as it is a two-year old car. I told him to clean the window channels with some silicone spray and paper towels until the towels come out mostly clean to help prevent a recurrence.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I don\\\\u2019t wash my car until it looks quite dirty. Sometimes a month or two will pass. What I do is clean my glass constantly inside and out. If there are lots of bugs, twice a day on the windscreen may be warranted. A Califonia blade and a spray bottle of windscreen fluid speeds up the process on the side and back glass. I also clean my wiper blades every time I do my screen. What I have found from wiping my screen so often is that a significant amount of dust and soot collects on the car within an hour because any drops from cleaning the screen are quite dirty.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are a clean freak, you probably wipe the sills. Remember to clean up under the hood every couple of months and check that the dealer lubricates the locks and hinges by wiping off the old lithium grease just before you carry it in for service.

       "   4: ': \"Neither! And I\\\\u2019ll tell you exactly why!\\\\n\\\\nAs a detailer, and one who really cares for his clients and there vehicles, I believe that there is no good reason to use and automatic car wash. In fact I myself and my customers stay away from them at all cost! Lets go over the main reasons why detailers and professionals alike, avoid automatic car washes and recommend their clients to do so as well.\\\\n\\\\n1) Harmful Acidic Cleaners-\\\\n\\\\nAutomatic car washes such as touch less washes use very very VERY harmful acidic cleaners, such as Hydrofluoric Acid [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid ] and many others. Hydrofluoric acid is one of the strongest and most harmful inorganic acids. When used full strength it can corrode glass, paint, plastics and a plethora of other materials on a your vehicle. To give you an even better idea of how strong and dangerous this acid is, its the same acid used in the popular hit TV show Braking Bad in order to dissolve bodies. This type of acidic cleaner is mainly found in touch-less washes, their is no physical contact between the wash and your vehicle in order to agitate dirt, salt and other types of contaminants. So in attempt to remove and brake down such contaminants, touch-less automatic washes use harsh cleaners like Hydrofluoric acid. The results are weakened waxes, sealants, clear coats, plastics and many other surfaces. The use of this acid became so popular in the automatic car wash industry that the Center for Disease Control issued a written warning to all car washes [ https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6432a4.htm?s_cid=mm6432a4_w ].\\\\n\\\\n2) Scratches, and lots of them-\\\\n\\\\nWe all remember the old automatic car washes that used hard bristle brushes, well for the most part those are a thing of the past. They have been replaced with ether touch-less car washes or mitter curtain car washes. Mitter curtains are produced using a \\\\u201csofter\\\\u201dcloth like material, they drag of the surface of your vehicle in order to remove dirt. That sounds good and all, BUT! hundreds of vehicles are being serviced 24/7. So unless your the first one on a fresh set of mitter curtains, you can be assured that you are driving through wet sand paper.\\\\n\\\\n3) Water Spots & Hand Drying-\\\\n\\\\nAnd the damage does not stop during the washing process, your car is being damaged while being dried as well. At the end of your automatic car wash you vehicle receives a cool, but useless, breeze from industrial blowers. All this does is move water from one spot of your vehicle to another, and that is why vehicles come out looking like the one above. Water spots are not easy to remove once dried, they sometimes need to be removed by polishing the effected area. To solve this problem automatic car washes started implementing free hand drying. Sound like a great idea until you figure out that low quality towels are being used and the cleanliness of the towels is very questionable.\\\\n\\\\n4) Profit is Main Priority\\\\n\\\\nAnother thing you have to remember is that an automatic car washes main priority is profit and speed. These two characteristic never result in quality at the end of the day. Automatic washes use, cheap products, tools, and even water. Yes even the water used in automatic car washes is typically low quality, and full of mineral deposits. All of this combined gives you end result that less then desired, and a waste of money.\\\\n\\\\n5) Water waste & Bad For Our Environment-\\\\n\\\\nA typical automatic car wash uses repulsive amounts of water, upwards of 100 gallons! You only need 10 to 15 gallons of water to properly wash a vehicle like a midsize SUV. When you put the hundreds of gallons wasted along side the harmful chemicals, you start to understand why Automatic car washes are not only bad for your vehicle but also our environment.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information regarding car detailing check out our website bellow!\\\\n\\\\nCarNewba Detailing [ https://carnewbadetailing.com/blog-and-news ]\", \"',\n",

Why do we have to clean before the maids come?\\\\n\\\\nThere are three different concepts that many people generally consider cleaning. One is decluttering, which is the actual removal of things that you no longer use or want that is in your house and creating clutter because it has no place it permanently lives. Another is organizing, which is giving everything you want and use in our house a place to permanently live. And finally is actual cleaning, which is removing dirt and debris from surfaces in your home.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I cleaned houses, there was a specific list of things I did. None of it ever involved decluttering or organizing. All of it was about cleaning. However, unless I was paid an additional sum for it, I did wash, dry, fold/hang, and store clothing and other laundry and I would also wash dishes. If I was not paid extra for that, I did not do it. The reason you want to declutter, organize, and do things like dishes and take out the trash and completely do your laundry before the person who cleans your house comes over is to make it easier to do a good job. Many house cleaners get paid by the hour. Do you really want the house cleaner to have to move your piles of laundry and dirty dishes to be able to clean your floors and kitchen surfaces? Because that delays them and means you will be paying more. Some cleaners are given a limit to the amount of time they can spend in the client\\\\u2019s home cleaning, so if you have a huge pile of laundry on the floor in your laundry room or closet, and I\\\\u2019m not getting paid to do your laundry for you, I\\\\u2019m cleaning around it. That means whatever surface they\\\\u2019re on is not getting clean because I don\\\\u2019t have time to do it.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are doing more than getting the house prepared for the cleaners to come\\\\u2026 like doing laundry, organizing your things so they\\\\u2019re where they belong, doing dishes, and decluttering, you should not be paying other people to do what you\\\\u2019ve already done and asking why you do that is a really good question. You really do need to know exactly what services your cleaners are supposed to be doing and do everything but that. If you don\\\\u2019t have a clear idea of what they do, ask them. You can even ask them (or the person who owns the business) what would be helpful for you to have done before they come so you aren\\\\u2019t overdoing it.

You don\\\\u2019t need to have taken a chemistry course to follow it, and you don\\\\u2019t need laboratory measuring tools.\\\\n\\\\nIf you find only 91% isopropyl alcohol available buy it and dilute it to 70%, because the 30% water makes it more effective at killing virus.\\\\n\\\\nThe simple way to do this is to add 0.3 part water (three tenths) to one part 91% alcohol.\\\\n\\\\nMore generally, divide the higher concentration by the lower concentration and subtract one, to get the amount of water to add to alcohol, by ratio of parts.\\\\n\\\\nThe utility of using a ratio in parts water to parts alcohol is that any measurement units can be used. You can scale up the ratio to make it more convenient, say, 3 parts water to ten parts 91% alcohol. Whatever the capacity of your measuring container, put in 3 of water and ten of 91% alcohol.\\\\n\\\\nWhy does this work? When you dilute the alcohol the amount of alcohol remains the same while the concentration and volume change. The amount of alcohol is the concentration times the volume, C times V. So C(1) times V(1) equals C(2) times V(2) because no alcohol has been added or subtracted. Setting V(1) to a value of one allows a calculation by parts instead of units. Subtracting one part from the total volume gives the amount of water to be added, per part.\\\\n\\\\nThe trick is to have a container for measuring and mixing and storing. The bottles of alcohol you buy will be full.\\\\n\\\\nIt is better to measure the water first rather than add it to alcohol until the desired volume level is reached in the alcohol container. Alcohol absorbs water, so that the volume of the two when mixed is less than the combined separate volumes of each. The new concentration is correct even while the total volume is slightly less than expected by simply adding the numbers.\\\\n\\\\nI had to figure all this out for myself from instructions for solution dilution in the lab, which assume you have the knowledge and equipment.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAs an added note on my own answer, it is hard to find isopropyl alcohol on the store shelves. A restocked shelf is quickly emptied. I haven\\\\u2019t seen 91% solution since March, just 70%, and the only ones left, if there are any left, are 16 oz size, no quart sized. I have only one quart of 91% left to dilute, but ample supplies of 70% half quarts, which are easier to hold when pouring. I pour from the 16 oz size into my 2 oz spray bottles.\\\\n\\\\nI urge people to use a spray and spread with a hand, rather than waste alcohol by using a cloth or paper towel. If you use a wiping rag most of the alcohol will be absorbed by the material and evaporate, only a portion will be spread on the surface. By contrast, If you use the spray and hand spread method, your hand is protected by the alcohol and you can feel directly to be sure that the whole surface is covered. The 70% solution doesn\\\\u2019t damage my skin. Using this method, an ounce of alcohol goes a long way. Smaller 2 oz spray bottles are more efficient and can be carried with you. I have one in my car and one on my person. I should note that mini spray bottles are sold out fast, so they must be in demand.\\\\n\\\\nAt a self serve gas station, first spray your hands then operate the pump. When finished, again spray down and rub your hands together before you open the door to your car, rubbing the spray bottle itself as you rub your hands. Other than myself, I have not seen anyone take precautions at a gas pump, so you can be pretty sure that sooner or later the fixtures that have to be handled will be contaminated. This procedure is very quick and sure, no risk of being harassed for taking precautions.\", \"',\n",

Get out your favorite cooking oil (olive, canola, Crisco - doesn\\\\u2019t matter which). Pour a table spoon of oil into the palm of your left hand. Make a hand washing motion, so you distribute the oil over both hands, front and back. Now clean your hands without using soap. You can use paper towels, but no wet wipes which have soap in them. You can use cloth towels. You can hold your hands under running water at a sink for as long as you like.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ll wait.\\\\n\\\\nIsn\\\\u2019t this fun?\\\\n\\\\nPretty clean now, right?

You just can\\\\u2019t get them all off your body, or your cloths, or your dishes without soap.\\\\n\\\\nThe technical part of the answer is, water is a polar molecule. Lots of other things in this world are polar. Water is great for cleaning up other polar molecules. Perhaps you\\\\u2019ve heard the phrase, \\\\u201cLike attracts like\\\\u201d? It\\\\u2019s true in a lot of chemistry. But oils and greases and fats are nonpolar molecules. Water is terrible at combining with, or dissolving nonpolar molecules. You need another nonpolar molecule if you want to remove grease. Or you need soap to dissolve nonpolar molecules (grease) in polar molecules (water). Soaps are really cool molecules with a polar end and a nonpolar end. The soap\\\\u2019s nonpolar end can bind to the nonpolar grease and the soap\\\\u2019s polar end can bind to the polar water.\\\\n\\\\nThe even more technical part of the answer gets into the chemical and even quantum mechanical definitions of polar and nonpolar molecules.

       "   5: ': \"Mechanical washing machines showed up in the mid 1800s, in spite of the fact that they were all hand-fueled. Early models cleaned garments by scouring them, while later models cleaned garments by moving them through water. Steam-fueled business washers showed up during the 1850s, however home washing machines remained totally hand-controlled until the mid 1900s, when a few organizations began making electric machines. The Automatic Electric Washer Company and Hurley Machine Corporation both started selling electric washers in 1907, while Maytag offered an electric wringer washer in 1911. In 1947, Bendix offered the primary completely programmed washing machine, and by 1953 turn dry machines surpassed the wringer types in prominence.\\\\n\\\\nThe last wringer washer made in the United States was made in June of 1990 at Speed Queen\\'s plant in Ripon, Wisconsin. The major U.S. producers today are General Electric, Maytag (Montgomery Ward), Speed Queen (Amana and Montgomery Ward), Whirlpool (Kenmore), and White Consolidated (Frigidaire and Westinghouse).\\\\n\\\\nNumerous models with many fluctuating highlights are currently accessible; be that as it may, with a couple of special cases, just the controls are unique. The main distinction between the washer in your home and the top-load washers in the laundromat is the roughness of development.\\\\n\\\\nThe washing machine works by an engine, which is associated with the fomenter through a unit called a transmission. The engine and transmission are close to the base of the machine, while the instigator stretches out up through the center of the machine. The transmission is like the transmission in your vehicle in that it alters the speed and course of the fomenter. One way (unsettle), the transmission changes the turn of the instigator and turn tub\\\\u2014within tub with little openings in it\\\\u2014into a forward and backward movement. At the point when the engine is turned around by the controls (turn), the transmission bolts up and the fomenter, transmission, and turn tub all pivot as a unit. Without the transmission altering the speed or course, the unit utilizes outward power to expel however much water from the garments as could be expected. The engine is additionally associated with a siphon. At the point when the engine is moving in the turn bearing, the siphon expels the water from the tub and disposes of it through the channel pipe.\\\\n\\\\nModels intended for use in different nations offer various highlights. One part required on all models sold in England (and potentially soon in the remainder of Europe) is known as the cover lock. Typically when the cover is raised the washer must stop for security reasons. Be that as it may, in England, when the washer is working the cover must be bolted shut.\\\\n\\\\nRaw Materials\\\\n\\\\nNumerous pieces of a washing machine are made from sheet steel, generally covered with zinc to improve imperviousness to rust. The steel maker supplies the metal in a curl, which enables the material to be sliced to estimate with least waste or naturally encouraged into the framing procedure. On certain models made by Speed Queen, the turn tub is made of tempered steel. Every single other model utilize a steel (called enameling iron) intended for a porcelain covering. For the wash tub, which isn\\'t unmistakable except if you open the machine bureau, enameling iron with a porcelain covering is commonly utilized. Whirlpool is the special case, utilizing plastic as opposed to enameling iron for the external wash tub.\\\\n\\\\nNumerous different parts are plastic too. Producers get crude plastic from which they create parts in pieces about the size of a little subterranean insect, utilizing them for machine segments that don\\'t bear weight and additionally require amazingly great imperviousness to rust. Such parts incorporate the siphon, the tub watches (which keep your garments from being tossed out of the turn tub into the wash tub or the bureau region), and the instigator.\\\\n\\\\nThe transmission is commonly produced using thrown aluminum, which touches base from the producer in ingots\\\\u201420 pound sections of aluminum. Scrap parts are normally remelted and reused. Hoses, controls (clocks, switches, and so on.), and engines are obtained in pre-assembled structure from different producers.\\\\n\\\\nThe Manufacturing Process\\\\n\\\\nThe assembling procedure is part into manufacture (making parts), sub-gathering (assembling parts to make segments), and get together (assembling the segments to frame the last item). The manufacture procedure contains a few distinct techniques, every particular to a specific kind of crude material\\\\u2014sheet metal, plastic, or aluminum. When the constituent parts have been made, they are gathered; significant sub-congregations, or segments, incorporate the transmission, the siphon, the turn and wash tubs, the parity ring, and the painted parts. At long last, the sub-gatherings are assembled inside the shell of the washer, which is then finished.\\\\n\\\\nManufacture\\\\n\\\\n1 Most sheet metal parts are shaped by a machine called a press. This name is very elucidating, as the machine really presses (or crushes) a bit of sheet metal between two parts of a shape called a kick the bucket. The metal will appear as the space between the parts of the kick the bucket. Since metal in parts molded by just beyond words to wrinkle, break, or tear, numerous kicks the bucket are commonly used to shape every segment. Where conceivable, the metal is sustained straightforwardly from a loop into the press. At the point when this is absurd, the metal is sliced to length and physically (or, with bigger parts like the bureau, naturally) put into the bite the dust.\\\\n\\\\n2 Plastic parts are framed in an infusion embellishment machine, a metal form with at least one cavities in the state of the ideal part. In the wake of being warmed to its softening point, the plastic is constrained into the shape under high weight. Next, water is gone through the shape to cool and harden the part. The shape is then opened and the part pushed out by ejector pins. When you take a gander at a plastic part, you frequently can see little circles made by these pins.\\\\n\\\\n3 Aluminum transmission parts are framed into a harsh shape in a kick the bucket cast machine, which works much like an infusion form with the exception of that it doesn\\'t utilize weight. The Most of the key segments\\\\u2014transmission, engine, broke get together\\\\u2014are housed underneath the fomenter. The equalization ring is a weighted ring that shields the washer from moving around during activity.\\\\n\\\\nThe greater part of the key segments\\\\u2014transmission, engine, broke gathering\\\\u2014are housed beneath the fomenter. The equalization ring is a weighted ring that shields the washer from moving around during task.\\\\n\\\\nliquid metal is precisely spooned into the form and cooled. The resulting unpleasant throwing is then given its last shape by different machines which drill gaps, shave overabundance metal off basic surfaces, or remove metal from the part.\\\\n\\\\nSub-gatherings\\\\n\\\\n4 The transmission is gathered physically by laborers who jolt, snap, or press (tight fit) a few shafts and riggings together. Specialists at that point include a metered measure of oil and jolt the unit together.\\\\n\\\\n5 The siphon is collected naturally. Robots place the impeller and seals in the spread and body, and seal the siphon. A few makers use warmth and others vibration (which produces heat) as a sealant.\\\\n\\\\n6 The tub parts are made in presses, and the sub-get together is fabricated consequently. Subsequent to being folded into a drum shape, the side is welded. The weld is then smoothed out and the drum is set on a unit called an expander, which stretches the tub into its last shape. A base is then welded onto the drum, and this weld is likewise smoothed. On the off chance that the tub is treated steel it is cleaned so it won\\'t catch the garments. Generally the tub is plunged in an answer called a ground coat and warmed to around 1600 degrees until this covering solidifies. In the event that the tub won\\'t be obvious (the wash tub), the unit is finished. On the off chance that the tub will be unmistakable (the turn tub), a completion coat is connected after a similar methodology utilized with the ground coat; this last coat gives the tub either a white or blue shading.\\\\n\\\\n7 The parity ring is a huge weight that balances out the washer. Its outside structure is plastic, with a ring of metal softened into the plastic for quality. Concrete is included and adjusted exactly. This ring, which gauges in excess of twenty pounds, keeps the machine from \\\\\"strolling,\\\\\" or moving about, when it is being used.\\\\n\\\\n8 Washing machine makers utilize any of a few painting forms. One maker uses steel that has been prepainted by the steel producer. Albeit less expensive, this kind of steel does not offer the best rust security on the grounds that the cut edges are not painted. Different organizations treat their parts with different synthetic compounds to perfect and prepared them before applying paint. Sometimes, the paint arrives in a powder with a flour-like consistency. Blended with air and given an electrical charge, the powder is showered on the part, which is dangled from an overhead transport and given a contrary charge so it and the powder will pull in each other. In the wake of splashing, the transport moves the part into a broiler that melts the paint; when the part cools, the paint procedure is finished.\\\\n\\\\nGet together\\\\n\\\\n9 This procedure starts with mounting the transmission on the parity ring. The transmission is determined to a direction that is darted on the wash tub; the wash tub is perched on a transport. Another bearing (the lower bearing), the brake get together, and the drive pulley are put on the finish of the transmission. Next, a turning system called the rotate vault and legs are darted on the get together to hold every one of the pieces together.\\\\n\\\\n10 Using a using pressurized water worked instrument, laborers at that point lift this gathering, called the module, onto the washer base. Springs are added to hold module and base together. A seal is included, the turn tub is dashed to the transmission within the wash tub, and its plastic spreads are fit properly. A plastic center, which joins the fomenter to the transmission, is catapulted onto the yield end of the transmission shaft. At that point the fomenter is snapped onto the center.\\\\n\\\\n11 The siphon and a mounting section are presently catapulted onto the engine, which is then fitted with a shield to ensure against potential breaks. This get together is rushed to the base of the washing machine and associated with the transmission module with a belt and hoses.\\\\n\\\\n12 Next, the cover pivots are appended to the top and the top. The highest point of the washer is rushed to the bureau with a pivot for simple support. A blending valve to control the blend of hot and cold is rushed to the back of the bureau. The designs board, which gives words and pictures to clarify the controls, is mounted on the control board; the controls themselves are connected from the back. The wiring, associated as one unit, is known as an outfit. The bridle is cut to the control connectors toward one side, and the opposite end is gone through an opening in the top to be mounted to the engine. As a result of its enormous size and weight, the bureau get together is then set in the washer by a robot.\\\\n\\\\n13 The bureau is dashed to the base, and the controls are snapped together with the mating connectors on the module and engine. The channel hose is pulled through the bureau and a section called the gooseneck is included. This part is the thing that gives the hose its snare shape so it will affix into the channel. In the wake of being tried, the front board is dashed on, and a bundle of data and adornments is included.\\\\n\\\\n14 The completed unit is crated naturally. A machine opens the cardboard box, which was level for shipment, and drops it over the washer. The top and base folds are all the while collapsed over and stuck. At that point the machine applies weight on the top and base of the container to ensure the paste sets appropriately. After the paste has set, the machine puts a banding lash around the highest point of the carton to include quality for lift truck transportation (the units are conveyed from the top to decrease the danger of harm).\", \"',\n",

They are extremely popular here in Italy, and they are fairly easy to use with single use gloves. But using them with dishwashing gloves is essentially impossibile.\\\\n\\\\nNow, when should you use disposable goves? You only need them briefly while at the store. You put them on as you grab the cart (if you use it at all), take them out as you leave. If you are being served by an assistant you don\\\\u2019t even need the gloves as you will not be touching anything in the shop. One thing you should never do its wear the gloves throughout the day or, anyhow, from the moment you leave home to the moment you come back. The gloves do not protect your hands (you don\\\\u2019t catch Covid-19 through the skin), they are used to protect the others from getting in contact with surfaces that you contaminated. If you don the gloves before leaving home and take them off once you are back home nd wear them for hours you are actually less aware of how many surfaces you touch, and you end up picking up lots of viruses and bacteria. Basically, the gloves worn for a long time are a vehicle for the infection.\\\\n\\\\nBased on the same principle, wearing dishwashing gloves, besides being extremely impractical, causes you to reuse the same gloves over and over. These gloves can\\\\u2019t be properly disinfected as they get damaged by the common disinfection procedures overtime. Indeed, the best strategy is not wearing gloves at all unless you are shopping or using the transit system.

       "   3: ': \"As the owner of London\\\\u2019s best cleaning company - Glimmr [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk ], maybe I can shed some light on what it is like working with home cleaning companies and why you should consider doing the same:\\\\n\\\\nIn today\\\\u2019s day and age, everybody enjoys a clean home, but very few have the time to properly get the job done. If they do, it usually comes at the price of other leisure activities they might have planned for themselves. Frankly, sometimes we all deserve a little break. Whether we are a high profile business woman or a stay at home dad, everyone should be able to once in a while put their feet up and let someone else do the work for a change.\\\\n\\\\nStill not convinced? Not to worry, here are 8 more reasons why we think you should hire a domestic cleaning service:\\\\n\\\\n1. MORE FREE TIME\\\\n\\\\nWho doesn\\\\u2019t enjoy more free time, right? Cleaning is a chore that can demand hours of your time in order to do a thorough job. With work and other commitments taking up most of your week, you want to spend your remaining time on fun activities \\\\u2013 and for most of us, cleaning isn\\\\u2019t one of them.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s worse is that cleaning can sometimes be a high energy task, causing us to exert most of our energy scrubbing and washing the nooks and crannies of our home. At this point, we may find that even after investing all that time cleaning, the satisfaction of a clean home is ofset by the exhaustion from the clean. This means that you might feel a lot more tired a lot less likely to take your mates up on that offer to hang out later that night.\\\\n\\\\n2. A PERSONALISED CLEANING PLAN\\\\n\\\\nCompanies like Glimmr [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk ] can make a personalised cleaning plan that suits your needs. We take into account your unique situation and pain points around the house before your clean and work towards making these a thing of the past. Our professional cleaners are trained in a whole range of cleaning activities and are well suited for taking those pesky tasks off your hands.\\\\n\\\\n3. A WEALTH OF EXPERTISE\\\\n\\\\nMost of us might encounter a mess from time to time that we don\\\\u2019t know how to properly deal with. Issues such as limescale on your taps [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/how-to-remove-limescale-from-your-home/ ], spilt wine on your carpet [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/how-to-keep-your-carpet-clean/ ] or grime on your windows [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/window-cleaning-101/ ] can all appear a bit daunting if you haven\\\\u2019t dealt with them before. This is where a domestic cleaner can help save the day. Experienced cleaners would\\\\u2019ve seen it all before and will be well equipped to deal with a host of situations that might seem daunting to you.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you hire a domestic cleaning service, you are hiring professionals with a wealth of experience and expertise. At glimmr, our cleaners have been carefully vetted to ensure that only the best and most experienced cleaners make it to your front door.\\\\n\\\\n4. SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND\\\\n\\\\nA reliable domestic cleaning service is one that doesn\\\\u2019t require you to be at home. After all, what is the benefit of more free time if it means you have to stay and watch your cleaner while they work? Using a reliable domestic cleaning service will give you the peace of mind to leave your home, enjoy your day and come back to a beautifully clean home. Think of it a bit like room service in a hotel.\\\\n\\\\nWe think there\\\\u2019s too much living for you to do to be cooped up in your house for a couple of hours each weekend.\\\\n\\\\n5. GETTING TO THE AREAS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED\\\\n\\\\nFor some of us, cleaning can be a chore that comes out of necessity. You see a dirty home, and you feel it\\\\u2019s about time to give it a quick clean and go back to whatever you were doing before it.\\\\n\\\\nYour domestic cleaner, however, doesn\\\\u2019t see it that way. Domestic cleaners know how to maximise efficiency without compromising on quality. They can do this, because after years of cleaning, they know exactly how to and where to clean. This includes areas that most people often overlook. This means that hiring a domestic cleaning service will often result in a cleaner home than if we were to undertake the task ourselves.\\\\n\\\\n6. SPECIALISED EQUIPMENT\\\\n\\\\nA major reason for hiring a domestic cleaning service is access to specialised equipment that you wouldn\\\\u2019t just have lying around the house. That is unless you\\\\u2019re one of the few individuals that just happens to collect these as a hobby.\\\\n\\\\nHaving access to this type of cleaning equipment as well as professionals trained to use them can help you get the type of clean that you just wouldn\\\\u2019t be able to replicate at home.\\\\n\\\\n7. YOU CAN HOST MORE NIGHTS IN\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s usually 2 main reasons most people shy away from hosting more nights in with friends. One of them is not having a clean enough home to host others in and another is a fear of the effort it would take to clean up after our guests leave.\\\\n\\\\nEither way, there\\\\u2019s one common factor in both these cases and it has to do with cleaning our home \\\\u2013 or not wanting to. But it doesn\\\\u2019t have to be so! Hiring a regular domestic cleaning service can ensure that your home is clean throughout the week and you can have more hassle free nights in with those that matter.\\\\n\\\\n8. LESS FIGHTS WITH YOUR PARTNER\\\\n\\\\nNow fights with a partner over cleaning are something that affect nearly us all. These can stem from forgetting to clean a plate that was meant to be cleaned or not cleaning up to the standard of our significant other. Wouldn\\\\u2019t it be great if this task could be handed over to someone else? (No, we don\\\\u2019t mean your partner. That\\\\u2019s what got you into this mess to begin with.)\\\\n\\\\nYou guessed it \\\\u2013 a regular domestic cleaning service can take this problem off both you and your partner\\\\u2019s shoulders.

Another drawback is that when metal fittings are used with PEX, they present a completely separate issue for corrosion and fatigue concerns which often result in undetected hidden leaks and sometimes unforeseen catastrophic failures. In some cases, one must run one larger diameter PEX in order to counter the increased friction losses; IE: 5/8\\\\u2033 PEX versus 1/2\\\\u2033 CPVC, in other cases the difference balance out, but it must be considered when engineering the job.\\\\n\\\\nOther concerns are that while CPVC is immune to chlorine degradation, PEX is highly susceptible to chlorine degradation which has been proven to lead to failures within ten years of installation. PEX is also a permeable material, meaning that contaminants coming in contact with the outside of the pipe may be transmitted through the pipe wall leading to water contamination. This has been proven in testing as well as seen in the field where even the ink imprinted on the outside of the tubing by the tubing manufacturer has leached through the thickness of the tubing wall. In application the permeability of PEX can allow water to be contaminated from external sources such as contact with contaminated soil, insulation, and even offgasing vapors trapped in floor/wall cavities. PEX is also more prone to support biofilm formation than CPVC.\\\\n\\\\nAll that being said, I would avoid using PEX in chlorinated water systems and certainly would not bury it in the ground or walls where I thought it would be exposed to external contamination. Then again, I oppose burying all utilities in floors/walls because it\\\\u2019s just begging for suffering an unseen disaster. I don\\\\u2019t have any opposition to using PEX with non-chlorine and uncontaminated well water systems.

       "   3: ': \"It depends. Something I don\\\\u2019t see any mention of here so far is the great difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between PVC and concrete. If you bury 100\\\\u2032 of PVC pipe in 100\\\\u2032 of concrete and run enough hot water down the pipe to warm it up 50\\\\u00b0 F the pipe will grow about 3.5\\\\u2033. The concrete, warmed up the same 50\\\\u00b0, will only grow about 1/3\\\\u2033. See the problem? It is linear, doesn\\\\u2019t change with changing the normal temperature or reversing the direction of change, IE cooling it down. If located outside, in my neck of the woods we have to figure on a 150\\\\u00b0 difference between the coldest winter night and the hottest summer day. That is a 10.5\\\\u2033 difference in the length of that pipe, 1\\\\u2033 for the concrete. If the pipe simply runs straight through the concrete and ends after exiting the far side with no fittings or changes of direction, possibly no problem: The pipe would stick out of the concrete at the far end 9.5\\\\u2033 farther on the hottest day than it did in January. If there is anything that would tend to not let the pipe move freely in the concrete, something will break to let it move. Thermal expansion/contraction cannot be prevented, it can only be compensated for. That is why bridges have a minimum of exp/cont joints at one or both ends: If the bridge can\\\\u2019t shrink and grow with the seasons, it will destroy itself.\\\\n\\\\nI saw this demonstrated once in a tunnel that ran from a powerplant to the dam, several hundred feet long. 4\\\\u2033 PVC under a concrete walkway, with a floor drain teed in every now and then. It was winter, and the contractor chose to mix the concrete with warm water, so there wasn\\\\u2019t much delay before it was obvious that it wasn\\\\u2019t going to work. Every one of those floor drains was anchored in place and sat at the end of about a foot of pipe teed off from the main. When they got as far as the first floor drain that foot of pipe to the drain was bent. Muttering about the plumbers, they moved the floor drain a couple inches to straiten out the bent pipe. When they got to the next floor drain, the pipe to it was broken off! The floor drain was still where it belonged, but the tee for its connection had moved down the tunnel 4\\\\u2033. Checking the rest of the drains, they found them all broken off.\\\\n\\\\nI wasn\\\\u2019t normally on that part of the job, so I don\\\\u2019t know or remember what they did to correct the situation. They make slip joints for pipe and if enough of them are properly installed they will allow the pipe sections between them to shrink and grow without destroying anything. That is what I would have done. Incidentally, this is why it is problematic to use PVC to plumb tall buildings: guy on the top floor takes a hot shower, the pipe warms up and grows enough to bust off the tees to all the tubs, toilets and sinks.\\\\n\\\\nSo like i said, it depends. CPVC is even worse and some other plastics are worse than that. You have to compensate for thermal change, however much the material and design require. Obviously, short runs of pipe passing through concrete in a temperature stable location such as your basement shouldn\\\\u2019t be a problem. The \\\\u201clevel\\\\u201d portions of the piping installed during construction actually sets mostly in the gravel beneath the slab and can move a little.\\\\n\\\\nSteel\\\\u2019s coefficient of thermal expansion is close to the same as concrete, especially particular steels. That is why you can use steel rebar and mesh in concrete. The figure used for generic construction for steel and concrete is .0000055\\\\u2033 per inch per degree F, but depending on the aggregate concrete can vary from 3.8 to 7 millionths and different alloys of steel vary a little. Typical figures for common piping: PVC is 28, ABS is 35, CPVC is 44, HDPE is 67, PE is 83, aluminum is 12.8, stainless steel is 9.9, copper is 9.3, carbon steel is 6.5 and cast iron is 5.9.

Compressed air is great for removing very loose dust and can be used to get to areas you wouldn\\\\u2019t be able to reach easily (an example could be the inner sides of the PC fans where the fan itself spins!)\\\\n\\\\n(not my image) Compressed air is not very expensive!\\\\n\\\\nAnother idea is also to use a piece of paper and to remove dust from things such as the fans, the inner parts of the PC case etc.\\\\n\\\\n * WHEN?\\\\nThe answer to this question can vary by a bit, you see, most GOOD PC cases have \\\\u201cdust filters\\\\u201d which looks like this for intake fans.\\\\n\\\\nMany cases also include a dust filter where the power supply is which can be \\\\u201cslid\\\\u201d out from under the case similar to the image below!\\\\n\\\\nNow, why am I talking about dust filters and not telling you a definitive answer? Because it really depends! For the average case (dust filter intake and PSU) I would recommend a cleaning every 2\\\\u20133months, by doing this you won\\\\u2019t have a lot of big lumps of dust, it will look good and cleaning it will be simple, I would recommend cleaning the dust filters a bit more often, though, as it\\\\u2019s not difficult, and there won\\\\u2019t be any airflow issues. If your PC is on a carpet you should clean it more often than once every 2\\\\u20133 months, Hayden Pollard suggested 2times a month and I agree if the dust filters aren\\\\u2019t great, but if they are doing a decent job, once every month should do!\\\\n\\\\n * CONCLUSION\\\\nCleaning the computer for dust can be very useful but it\\\\u2019s not something to stress all day about! There are many ways to clean the PC, most PC cases come with dust filters, which will help you as it will reduce dust buildup, you should clean these dust filters a bit more often than you do clean the case itself so there won\\\\u2019t be any airflow issues etc!\\\\n\\\\nI hope this helps!\\\\n\\\\nFeedback is always nice!\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"Why do computers specifically CPU work efficiently in the cold if cold temperature makes things move slow?\\\\n\\\\nMechanical systems with liquid lubrication tend to move more slowly when cold because the lubrication has higher viscosity and therefore is less slippery. This does not apply to semiconductor electronics, at least within the range of cold temperatures typical in human habitats. This is because electrical energy moves at the speed of light, and is not affected by temperature.\\\\n\\\\nLCD displays will slow down when cold, but that is because they have a liquid layer (the L in LCD) that becomes more viscous and presents more resistance to the twisting action of the crystals, which is what changes the light level of each pixel.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem for semiconductors is heat. Electrical resistance and leakage current in transistors, particularly when they are in the process of switching generates heat. If the heat becomes excessive, the leakage will increase, causing even more heating. Eventually the temperature will build up to the point where the devices on the chip are permanently damaged. This is why CPUs and other high-speed logic chips typically have heat sinks, and why PCs have cooling fans. The heat has to be extracted.\\\\n\\\\nCold can affect a computer system if extreme enough or if it causes condensation. If there are any disk drives, they may have an oil based grease on the spindle bearings that could stiffen up. And thermal contraction can cause connectors or a poorly formed solder joint to open up electrically. But the electronics will be just fine. LCD displays may become brittle. And if condensation is present, there can be short circuits.\\\\n\\\\nAll computer equipment has ratings for both storage and operation temperature limits. The manufacturer will have tested their products well beyond those limits, but exceeding them will void any warranty or service contract.\", \"',\n",

       "   5: ': \"No, don\\\\u2019t apply power until your computer has been fixed. If you don\\\\u2019t know enough yourself, leave it switched off at the mains until you take it to a professional repairer. Have a damn good look & see if you can see where the smoke came from, or any burnt components. Are you SURE the smoke came from the main processor & not elsewhere, particularly out of a the power unit? Smoke from the actual CPU would be unusual. If the processor itself is burnt out you\\\\u2019ll probably need another circuit board, or new computer. \\\\nYou could plug in another processor & possibly even upgrade to a better one, but the new CPU might get damaged if something that caused the old CPU to burn out is still present, or happens again. A lot of things are surface mounted, so not soldered in with an actual soldering iron. (It\\\\u2019s done by hot air). DO take a look at the power supply, removing any metal cover to it, before you just assume the power unit is OK. A magnifying glass can be useful. Sometimes even bits of copper track can get blown by a fault.\\\\n\\\\nThere are tiny electrolytic capacitors that often fail in power supplies. You can sometimes even see the metal tops, perhaps around half an inch in diameter, or often a bit less, bulging upwards. The capacitors are usually black or blue, with 105 deg. C written on them & often 100UF -2200, UF range, if anything, more common in the mid to higher end. NB, say, 470UF upwards. You can\\\\u2019t test suspect capacitors 100% with a capacitance meter, as they can read correct for value, (many have on my fluke 85,) but still be faulty. If they read very low in value then they will be faulty, but 5%- 10% low might still be be OK, and not the cause of a problem. An ESR meter can be better. Even little resistors can make a lot of smoke when they burn out, but something will be the cause of the excessive current flowing through them to burn them out badly in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nIf even 1 electrolytic capacitor has gone, for what they cost, I\\\\u2019d replace all around on the board with new ones, within reason. Of course, it might be something else & even several semiconductors might have been destroyed in an instant. Don\\\\u2019t solder in any components without wearing an anti-static wristband. That said, power supply boards tend to be less sensitive to static damage than some of the others when they are unplugged.\\\\n\\\\nWorking parts are working parts. There\\\\u2019s no advantage in replacing integrated circuits or semiconductors if they\\\\u2019re still ok, but electrolytic capacitors often degrade due to the heat & age. It can be worthwhile replacing them if you\\\\u2019ve taken them out to try & test them in the first place, rather than solder old electrolytic capacitors back in. It\\\\u2019s mainly things such as switches, batteries, ribbon cables that flex (on lap tops,) fans, & drives with their associated mechanics that actually wear out. Resistors can deteriorate with age, so if they are particularly discoloured and you can find the value, they could be replaced. No point putting a new resistor in if it\\\\u2019s badly burnt out & the cause not fixed.\\\\n\\\\nYou could try putting in your particular model of computer into an Internet and You Tube search, including \\\\u201cburnt out,\\\\u201d to see if anything comes up. Some models have common faults. I\\\\u2019m not sure what prompted you to put \\\\u201c because of an unstable voltage.\\\\u201d Did a trip need resetting in your house, or is it the power supply in your computer that you already know was faulty, or is it that somebody has told you that your computer PSU is defective? Someone might know faults on your particular model well if you add that to your original question.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a multimeter & can\\\\u2019t see anything obviously wrong with the power supply, you could disconnect it, gingerly power it up & if it doesn\\\\u2019t go bang, blow a fuse, or show obvious signs of distress or burning, check all the voltages coming out are correct. Even without a schematic (circuit diagram,)total lack of say, +5 volts for example, would be a certainty that the power unit was faulty, but be careful not to short out any pins with the meter test prods. I use a variac transformer to slowly increase the voltage up to normal AC mains level, looking for signs of distress from the power supply as I do it. If you\\\\u2019re lucky, there might even be a schematic on the Internet. Without an oscilloscope you can\\\\u2019t easily check everything about a power supply unit, ripple especially.\", \"',\n",
       "   6: ': \"Yes. As Rick Rouse explained, once the computer is hibernated, it is in exactly the same state as it would be if it was shut down normally. The difference is that the next time you start it back up, rather than starting from scratch, it will re-fill its RAM with all the contents from before, including open programs and all that good stuff. Thus you can safely work inside the computer.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I think it is important to mention that it is not wise to do a lot of work inside the computer while it\\\\u2019s hibernated. CPU fan/cooler, power supply, case fans are all fine. But if you\\\\u2019re swapping out any components that actually communicate with the mainboard, you should really shut it down properly.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason I say this is that part of what it has in RAM while it\\\\u2019s running is drivers for all your installed hardware. Once you resume from hibernate, it will try to re-load all the same drivers, assuming that all the hardware it can \\\\u201csee\\\\u201d is the same as the last time it was running. I would not expect a computer to be able to recognize and operate with new hardware if it was just hibernated.\\\\n\\\\nCPU coolers, power supplies, and case fans are all fine because the computer itself can\\\\u2019t \\\\u201csee\\\\u201d what kind of fan or power supply you have. All it knows is that it gives the fan power and the fan reports its rotation speed. Or in the case of the power supply, the computer asks for power and the power supply gives it. So I see no way for the computer to mess up if those components are swapped while it\\\\u2019s hibernated.\", \"',\n",

First is their confirmation of the existence of the aerosol effect even though it is largely  not publicized  or well known. \\\\\"Droplets are going all over the place \\\\u2014 it\\'s like the  Fourth of July,\\\\\" \\\\u2014 says Professor Gerba. \\\\\"One way to see this is to  place dye in your toilet, flush it, and then hold a piece of paper over  it\\\\\" (2) [ http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/09/something-in-the-water/376950/ ].  Gerba\\\\u2019s irrefutable research has shown that minute particles of water  in an invisible cloud travel 6-8 feet up and outwards, completely  contaminating the average sized bathroom. Ceilings, walls, and  partitions are problematic because they are likely to be overlooked in  the cleaning process. Bacteria will adhere to such surfaces and flourish  in the nearly always humid environment of a bathroom; if the situation  is not addressed; odors will remain in your bathroom and public  restrooms that we take for granted as having been meticulously cleaned.  The bacterial mist has also been proven to stay suspended in the air for  at least two hours after every flush, maximizing its chance to spread (3) [ http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1317/does-flushing-the-toilet-cause-dirty-water-to-be-spewed-around-the-bathroom ].  \\\\\"The greatest aerosol dispersal transpires not during the initial  moments of the flush, but once most of the water has already left the  bowl,\\\\\" according to Professor Philip Tierno, who recommends leaving the  bathroom immediately upon flushing so not to inhale the microscopic  airborne mist, which can have harmful medical consequences (4) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1839#4 ], particularly on seniors and the young.\\\\n \\\\nScientists at Leeds University have also tested the air above and surrounding toilets and found that the bacteria, C.difficile, [ http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/clostridium-difficile-colitis ] which causes vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal discomfort, streptococcus [ http://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/about/faqs.html ] (a form of strep throat and meningitis), E.coli [ http://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/ ], hepatitis A [ http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/ ], and staphylococcus [ https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/staphylococcalinfections.html ] (the virus behind food poisoning and a form of pneumonia) as well as a  host of other unpleasant and dangerous side effects. The study shows a  normal toilet flush discharges millions of microscopic C.difficile and  other bacteria around your toilet. The study did not take into  consideration ceiling fans, high-pressure toilets found on jetliners,  public toilets, stadiums, etc., or other devices now utilized in  bathrooms that can spread C.difficile many additional feet throughout  your bathroom and adjoining rooms.\\\\n \\\\nLest  we forget you\\\\u2019re newly potty-trained children who rise only slightly  above the amazing and awe inspiring thrust of water as the waste matter  strangely vanishes from sight. Oh yes, while he or she is standing  inches from the toilet in bare feet where it is a certainty that  C.difficile bacteria exists. And don\\\\u2019t forget grandma and grandpa who  have become scientifically interested in the shape, color, and size of  every bowel movement. Is it any wonder that young children and seniors  seem to have cold, flu and stomach illnesses more often than the rest of  your family? Reflect on just how far reaching germs and bacteria are  transported from your open toilet, even when it isn\\\\u2019t in use. In other  words, while unoccupied, an open toilet can and will spread C.difficile  and other harmful germs throughout your bathroom and home.\\\\n \\\\nWhile  toilets are clearly not sterile environments, they\\\\u2019re not as bad as  people might think because they receive more attention and are cleaned  more often. \\\\\"If aliens came from outer space and studied bacterial  counts, they probably would conclude it\\\\u2019s better to wash their hands in  your toilet and crap in your sink,\\\\\" Gerba said (1) [ http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/09/something-in-the-water/376950/ ]. The alien would almost certainly not put your toothbrush in their mouth because of its uncovered spot in the  bathroom, a hotspot for fecal bacteria discharged into the air by the  aerosol effect (5) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1839#5 ].  Understandably, the toothbrush with toilet droplets on it is one of the  most restated and repugnant stories to emerge from Professor Gerba\\'s  report.\\\\n \\\\nNevertheless,  there may even be larger consequences of the aerosol effect than the  brush and flush dilemma. Clearly all bathrooms should be cleaned more  painstakingly, and with an emphasis not just on, but in and around the  toilet, with equal emphasis on all surfaces because of the aerosol  effect. Using the appropriate cleaners is imperative because many  solutions are not necessarily antibacterial, whereas most bathroom  cleaners explicitly manufactured for use in bathrooms are labeled as  \\\\u201cdisinfectant\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cgermicidal.\\\\u201d Given that the sink area is teeming with  bacteria, one should be additional careful about washing hands properly  after using the bathroom for any non-toilet-related purposes like  washing your face or brushing your teeth. Using a hair dryer can also be  problematical in regards to bacteria counts because the effect would be  largely the same as a hot-air hand dryer, which actually increase the  bacteria on hands by 162 percent, as opposed to paper towels, which  decrease them by 29 percent (4) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web2/stan.html#7 ].  If you\\'re still not convinced that bacteria exist in any significant  quantities on your hands, consider that kitchen sink actually harbors  the most fecal matter in the average home, carried there by unwashed  hands after using the bathroom. A single tablespoon of bleach in a cup  of warm water on the offending sink will fix the situation... for the day.\\\\n \\\\nTo limit the effects of the aerosol effect, the easiest way is to close the lid on your toilet each time you flush (5) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web2/stan.html#5 ].  This will also provide peace of mind that while you\\\\u2019re washing your  hands for 30 seconds, the bacteria-laden water droplets won\\\\u2019t be  descending upon your body and clothing. Unfortunately, most public  toilets don\\'t have covers. Given the large number of people who use the  toilet before you, it probably wouldn\\'t make much difference. After  washing your hands, use a paper towel to turn off the faucet and to open  the door to leave, in order to avoid re-contaminated (4) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web2/stan.html#4 ]. And purchase new toothbrushes for your family and always keep them in a sealed medicine cabinet or some other enclosed place (2) [ http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f02/web2/stan.html#2 ].\\\\n \\\\nReferences\\\\n(1) The Potential Spread of Infection Caused by Aerosol Contamination of Surfaces After Flushing a Domestic Toilet [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16033465 ] by J.

With jobs, social engagements, school, extracurricular activities, and more, it can seem impossible to carve out any space for quality family time. It makes perfect sense that when we do finally get some time off, we\\'d rather spend it doing things we enjoy than cleaning up our homes. Nonetheless, these tasks do have to get done to keep everything in the home in working order. For some families, the best solution can be to hire cleaning services to take care of the work around the house that you\\'re not able to get to. Before you make a decision and call up a cleaning company in Edmonton [ http://khalidcleaning.com/contacts/ ], take some time to consider whether or not cleaning services are right for you.\\\\n\\\\n * Consider the cost\\\\nCleaners will typically charge between 15 and 45 dollars an hour, which can actually be more affordable than you\\'d think. The location of your home, the number of pets you have, and extra services that you may require can affect the cost, so make sure you do your research. If you have pets that are constantly leaving a mess around the house, you might be looking at the higher end of the price range.\\\\n\\\\n * Know your own worth\\\\nFind out what your time really costs. There are online calculators that can help you figure out your personal hourly rate to discover if you\\'re wasting your money by spending your time cleaning rather than doing something more productive. Use this number to help decide if it will save or cost you money to hire professional cleaners. You may find that cleaning services can do the job faster, meaning it would cost you less than doing it yourself.\\\\n\\\\n * Ask your friends\\\\nIf cleaning services providers are going to be entering your home regularly, you want to make sure you hire a company that you can trust. Ask your family and friends for recommendations and see how they\\'ve found the experience of having professional help. If someone you know trusts a service, then you probably can, too. This is also a good time to consider if you\\'re comfortable with having people in your home. If not, you may need to reconsider.\\\\n\\\\n * Separate your needs\\\\nCreate a list of the chores you really need done. Your requests are likely standard, but if you\\'re asking for things like dishes, making beds, and ironing, you might be looking at additional costs. You might want to consider splitting up your list into bigger tasks for the professionals and smaller tasks for you and your family. Even with a few chores still left on the list, your task load will be significantly shortened.\\\\n\\\\nHaving a professional cleaner isn\\'t for everyone, but if your chores are a significant source of stress in your life, you might want to consider it.

How do you make the right choice?\\\\n\\\\nHere are my five tips to get the service that\\\\u2019s right for you.\\\\n\\\\n1) Ask around\\\\n\\\\u2013 The best cleaning companies are small businesses, and small businesses thrive on word of mouth. A dependence on word of mouth necessitates a dedication to a job well done as well as top notch customer service. Who do your friends, families, and colleagues trust to clean for them?\\\\n\\\\n2) Research online\\\\n\\\\u2013 Look for companies who are well reviewed on Google, Facebook, Yelp, etc\\\\u2026 But don\\\\u2019t just look at the stars a company has been awarded, read reviews. Do the positive comments align with your own expectations? Are the negative comments fair?\\\\n\\\\n3) Call around\\\\n\\\\u2013 Do you feel like the person who answered the phone is attentive? Are they empathetic? Likable? Your home is a sacred place and cleaners are oftentimes invited into private corners not even best friends or family see. If you don\\\\u2019t feel listened to, understood, or you flat out don\\\\u2019t like the person on the phone, don\\\\u2019t bother inviting them into your home.\\\\n\\\\n4) Ask for a free estimate\\\\n\\\\u2013 Everyone has their own personal habits, beliefs, quirks, and challenges, so no two living spaces are the same, and no two sets of personal expectations are either. Make sure that if you are on a budget or have any concerns to address, you ask for a representative of the cleaning company to provide you a free estimate or quote. If taking you on as a client is important to them, they\\\\u2019ll invest the time to meet with you and earn your trust as well as your business.\\\\n\\\\n5) Demand a guarantee\\\\n\\\\u2013 No one\\\\u2019s perfect. That\\\\u2019s fine, most of us can live with that. What you shouldn\\\\u2019t live with, however, is a job not done to your standards. Any cleaner who takes pride in their work and values your business, word of mouth, and ability to type up a Google review, will at least come back to see why you\\\\u2019re not satisfied with their work. If they can do a better job, they should.\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \"There are several differences between a wood and a bamboo cutting board.\\\\n\\\\nStrength\\\\nA bamboo cutting board is a much harder alternative than a good quality wood board. Maple or Beech wood boards have a small amount of self-healing capacity, ensuring that the surface does not get heavily scratched. There are still more cuts and scratches on wood boards that bamboo.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a double edged sword however. Bamboo is much harder on the knife edge as it puts up much more resistance. This can dull knives quickly, and bamboo boards often have problems with cracking (if not properly oiled). The most common are cracks along the length of the grain between the dark and light wood. \\\\n\\\\nSanitation\\\\nFor food that gives off juices (meats and the like) bamboo (and plastic) boards are often the preferred method. A wood board is more likely to have juices flow into the small cuts and foster bacteria growth. However, with proper washing and sanitation, this is no problem. \\\\n\\\\nEco-Friendly\\\\nBamboo is a fast growing material, making it a much better renewable material that slow growing hardwoods. Bamboo has become the cutting board of choice with trendy patrons. \\\\n\\\\nOverall\\\\nI would usually choose a nice Maple or Beech cutting board for most applications, and a plastic (or maybe bamboo) for meats. I am very protective of the edge on my knives, and even with free lifetime sharpening, I\\'d rather not get to that point often.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"It depends on the board. Bamboo is not a tree but a grass. It has similar properties to wood from trees but it isn\\\\u2019t the same.\\\\n\\\\nBamboo grows in sections, each connected by a flared node. The problem is these nodes are INCREDIBLY hard compared to the in-between smooth sections of bamboo. As you know, cutting very hard objects is bad for knife edges. We already know hard stuff glass, ice, ceramic, steel, rock, and even the hardest woods like lignum vitae are unkind to knife edges.\\\\n\\\\nBamboo also doesn\\\\u2019t grow in such large pieces you can get a one-piece board made of bamboo. To make the boards, several pieces need to be bonded together. Some manufacturers use a glue or adhesive that hardens up to a high hardness. Again, cutting hard things is bad for knife edges.\\\\n\\\\nA manufacturer who knows what they are doing will minimize the amount of bamboo nodes included in the board and will use an adhesive that doesn\\\\u2019t dry excessively hard. This kind of bamboo board is definitely worth using and will be as good as your classic maple board.\\\\n\\\\nA manufacturer who doesn\\\\u2019t care or who doesn\\\\u2019t know what they are doing will include a lot of nodes and use a hard-drying adhesive. These boards are bad for your knife.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is sorting out the good from the bad. Manufacturers don\\\\u2019t really tell you very much. So getting random bamboo boards without knowing anything about them is like having a pillow fight but some of the pillows contain bricks.\", \"',\n",

Marble and granite cutting boards are the most popular options among stone boards.\\\\n\\\\nGrooved/Flat\\\\n\\\\nThere are grooved and flat boards available on the market.

Use a bleach solution or SoftScrub as well, and go all the way out to the edges. Very often, both sides of the board are used: one for meat, one for the rest, so treat both sides if necessary. Rinse really well, and allow to drain. If you can, stand the board in a sunny spot for a while: the sun is a magical deodorizer and disinfector.

Is it because they\\\\u2019re not qualified to do anything else?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m willing to bet that\\\\u2019s a common misconception. I started doing cleaning about three months ago. I\\\\u2019ve been out of work for a year. I\\\\u2019ve got two associate\\\\u2019s degrees, one in office systems technology and the other in accounting technology. I also have 130 credit hours (possibly more) toward a bachelor\\\\u2019s degree (yes, I know it only requires 120 but I changed my major and transferred colleges a couple of times, so the credit requirements changed). I have 15 years of experience as an administrative assistant, able to do both secretarial work and bookkeeping. I\\\\u2019ve also worked as a spa coordinator, a file clerk for a law office, a loan processor for a mortgage company, a purchasing agent for a sign manufacturing company, and a student life specialist for the office of student engagement at our local community college. If anything, I\\\\u2019m overqualified for most of the jobs available in my field and because of a combination of situations, including the recession 12 years ago during which time I went back to college, transferring universities because of my husband finishing his degree and not being able to find work where we were living, and working for crappy employers, as well as having my last job eliminated by the community college (I wasn\\\\u2019t fired, it just looks like I was), my resume makes it look like I am not a good employee. My previous coworkers would disagree with that statement. The students I worked with at the community college would strongly disagree as well.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to that, I have gone to cosmetology school and could easily (if expensively) renew my cosmetology license and probably get a job doing hair or esthetician work. Unfortunately, I don\\\\u2019t have the tools I once did to be able to do that, which would cost even more money that I would find it hard to justify. And I\\\\u2019ve not done either in so long that there are new techniques and such that I likely don\\\\u2019t know how to do and I have no way to update my knowledge base. But technically, I could get licensed and do this.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\u2019m either overqualified and they won\\\\u2019t hire me because they think I\\\\u2019ll leave if I get a better offer (I\\\\u2019m not getting any offers, so I doubt there is a chance of that) and having a spotty work history so I\\\\u2019ll leave because I\\\\u2019m a flake or I\\\\u2019m no longer licensed, so I\\\\u2019m not getting a job in my fields. With the current situation the world is in and the US in particular, I needed to be working while my husband was laid off or we would be homeless. I was willing to do just about anything that would pay my bills. A friend was looking for someone to clean her house and fold her laundry, a job she hates to do, so I agreed to do it. I wasn\\\\u2019t sure it was something I could physically do because I couldn\\\\u2019t clean my own house in one day without being out of commission the next day. But I did it and I didn\\\\u2019t hate myself in the morning. So I set up a profile on a website where people look for housekeepers and other in-home help and was contacted by a service that hires subcontractors to clean offices and houses. I\\\\u2019ve learned that this is not a job that just anyone can do. Most people can\\\\u2019t do it efficiently or thoroughly. Time is money and if you take more than a certain amount of time, you\\\\u2019re losing money for yourself and for the company. And if you aren\\\\u2019t thorough enough with an eye for detail, you wind up getting bad reviews for the company. So no, not just anyone and not just people with no job skills do this kind of work. In fact, I\\\\u2019m making more money doing this job than I would in any other job I am currently qualified for.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I do work with someone else, the person I work with most often used to work in home healthcare. So again, she is qualified to do other things and she prefers to do this. More money, less hours, and we can choose not to work weekends. It\\\\u2019s a job just like any other. I actually like that I\\\\u2019m often alone when I work and don\\\\u2019t have to deal with a micro-managing employer or lazy coworkers and often don\\\\u2019t have to deal with clients because many times they aren\\\\u2019t around when we clean. That isn\\\\u2019t to say that there aren\\\\u2019t people who do this kind of work because they aren\\\\u2019t qualified for other work, but we aren\\\\u2019t all \\\\u201cunskilled\\\\u201d labor.\", \"',\n",

If you don\\\\u2019t have proof of permission from the copyright holder, Amazon will give you a copyright infringement complaint.\\\\n\\\\nReview All your Suppliers and Stocks\\\\n\\\\nOne of the risks of selling branded products is being accused of selling fake items. This is why you need to review all your suppliers and check if all the products are authentic. It will also help to keep all your invoices so when you encounter issues with your suppliers, you\\\\u2019ll have evidence to show them.\\\\n\\\\nSell with FBA\\\\n\\\\nFulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is a program where you can send all your goods to Amazon and when they sell, Amazon will ship them for you. Various digital marketing and Amazon selling statistics [ https://muchneeded.com/amazon-statistics/ ] have shown over the years that selling with FBA can increase sales up to 5 times. Though FBA fees are higher than merchant fulfilled, your products are likely to sell faster and earn more profit. It can also help you save a lot of time and energy from individually wrapping packages and shipping them.\\\\n\\\\nFollow All Amazon Rules\\\\n\\\\nJust like other e-commerce platforms, Amazon also has many rules and regulations and they don\\\\u2019t often change their policies, unlike eBay. Before you start listing and selling your branded products, make sure you understand all rules set by Amazon. You can find all the specific policies on Seller Central and makes sure to adhere to them. This way, you can prevent any issue or complaint from Amazon.\\\\n\\\\nWin the Buy Box\\\\n\\\\nThe buy box can you be your key to increased sales. Notice that when a buyer clicks on one of the results, the buy box is the first thing to come up. To win the buy box, you need to sell a product or an item that no one else does or provide the lowest price including shipping. You can also create unique items by using Amazon\\\\u2019s bundling policy.\\\\n\\\\nDescribe your Products Accurately\\\\n\\\\nWhen listing your products [ https://blog.sellerschoice.digital/amazon-listing-optimization ], create accurate and detailed information to avoid any confusion among your prospects. If consumers are not sure if you are selling the exact items they need, they are not likely to buy them. Hence, if your descriptions are clear, they will know that these are the exact products and brands they are looking for.\\\\n\\\\nRespond to your Customers Quickly\\\\n\\\\nWhen a customer sends you a message about a specific item, Amazon lets you respond within 24 hours and if you don\\\\u2019t, that will be a disadvantage against your account. Check your Seller Central from time to time for customer questions so you won\\\\u2019t miss any. If you get one, answer it as quickly as you can. This way you can also create and drive customer loyalty [ https://referralrock.com/blog/driving-customer-loyalty/ ].\\\\n\\\\nFor more blogs and Amazon sellers services- check out AMZ One Step [ https://www.amzonestep.com/ ]\\\\n\\\\nArticle source: 10 Tips on How to Sell Branded Products on Amazon - [ https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/tips-to-sell-on-amazon/ ]\", \"',\n",
       "   4: ': \"When you\\\\u2019re selling expensive products, you already know that most of your prospects will raise price objections. The best way to stay in control of the conversation and lower their resistance to your product is to just bring up the price during your sales meeting.\\\\n\\\\nBy anticipating their objection, you show them that you\\\\u2019re confident enough about the product\\\\u2019s value to talk about its price in a natural way. You show that the benefit that they are going to get from your product totally justifies its price.\\\\n\\\\nHow can you demonstrate that your product is worth its price?\\\\n\\\\n * Highlight its value: The best way to make your prospect understand the real value of your product is by showing them in real numbers how much they are losing by not having your solution in place. This is even more effective than showing them how much they could win because people hate losing more than they love winning.\\\\n * Beat your competitors: Chances are that your prospect is trying to decide between you and a low-cost competitor. In this case, it\\\\u2019s your job to be an expert on your competitors and know precisely where they\\\\u2019re weak. Position your product as the best option in the market by focusing on the key benefits of your product and show them why your competitors can\\\\u2019t do what you do.\\\\n * Eliminate risk from the equation: If your prospect feels like your product is risky, they won\\\\u2019t buy it. Keep in mind that they could get fired for a bad purchase decision, so make them feel safe about your product by using case studies of existing clients. Perhaps even directly introduce your prospects to clients from their same industry that have become more successful with your product.\\\\nFinally, if you realize that your prospect doesn\\\\u2019t have enough money to buy your product, you can consider offering a price adjustment.\\\\n\\\\nUnlike discounts, price adjustments involve a commitment from both sides, i.e. a \\\\u201cgive to get\\\\u201d deal. You can ask your prospect to subscribe to your service for a whole year in exchange for an adjustment to the price, for example. The important thing here is that both parties win something in this situation.\", \"',\n",
       "   5: ': \"Selling products online and tapping into one of the fastest growing online business trends in internet history.\\\\n\\\\nAMAZON FBA\\\\n\\\\nThe term Amazon FBA stands for \\\\u2018Fulfillment by Amazon\\\\u201d. In this process of business, you need to send all your products and items to Amazon. Amazon is one of the most trusted names in the arena of online business.\\\\n\\\\nThey are the people who have a very large customer gamut or base throughout the world and their professionals can take care of all the functions related to inventory management and transportation and logistics of goods.\\\\n\\\\nIn this system of business, you need not worry about any operational hassles. However, you will have to abide by the rules and the regulations of Amazon, will have to share a huge part of the profit with Amazon and also the name of your brand will never gain eminence. To the customers, it will always seem that it is Amazon from where they are getting their products.\\\\n\\\\nIt is best to use ecommerce website development services like Shopify to do the job hassle free for you. So lets start with dropshipping now\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nDropshipping\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\u2019ve ever tried to find out for ways to make money online, you might have come across the term dropshipping.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve always wondered if starting a dropshipping business was a viable way to generate income. So, after doing some research, I decided to open my own dropshipping store.\\\\n\\\\nWithin 48 hours, I had setup my store, added about 30 products, run some paid advertising on Facebook, and made my first sale:\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m excited to continue my dropshipping experiment, but I also wanted to share the progress so far\\\\n\\\\nSo Let\\\\u2019s discuss..\\\\n\\\\nWhat is dropshipping?\\\\n\\\\nHow to start a dropshipping business: cost, logistics, suppliers, etc.\\\\n\\\\nMy dropshipping concept.\\\\n\\\\nPaid advertising and dropshipping?\\\\n\\\\nLessons I have learned.\\\\n\\\\nSo Let\\\\u2019s get to it!\\\\n\\\\nSo What is Drop Shipping?\\\\n\\\\nDropshipping is a retail strategy that involves outsourcing your manufacturing and fulfillment process.\\\\n\\\\nAs a dropshipper, you will never actually keep your products in stock. Rather, you purchase your stock from another merchant/manufacturer who then ship it directly to your customers.\\\\n\\\\nBy dropshipping, all you have to worry about is marketing and sales. Manufacturing, order fulfillment, and logistics are taken care of by the suppliers you source your products from.\\\\n\\\\nDrop shipping really requires arbitrage to be successful. In other words, you need to purchase your inventory for less than you sell.\\\\n\\\\nYou also need to reach your customers through marketing before your competition (or supplier) does, as well as hope your customers don\\\\u2019t do too much price comparison or shopping around.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, the need to buy cheap inventory leads to many dropshippers utilizing platforms like AliExpress to purchase items in bulk.\\\\n\\\\nYour dropshipping process might look like this:\\\\n\\\\nYou source a product from a cheap supplier on AliExpress. Let\\\\u2019s say, a pair of sneakers that cost $20.\\\\n\\\\nYou create an online storefront that sells this pair of sneakers for $60.\\\\n\\\\nWhen someone purchase these sneakers from your store, you pay $20 (the original price) for the supplier to ship the sneakers to your customer.\\\\n\\\\nThis costs you $20 but results in $40 of profit.\\\\n\\\\nNow Let\\\\u2019s see How to Start a Dropshipping Business:-\\\\n\\\\nThere is no exact formula for starting your own dropshipping business. After all, as long as you can create a situation of arbitrage (buying low, selling high), you can make money.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, there are some incredibly useful tips, tools, and strategies that can help you get on the right track with making money online.\\\\n\\\\nThis answer is going to get rather in-depth, and will cover these core concepts:\\\\n\\\\nConducting market research for dropshipping.\\\\n\\\\nSourcing your products.\\\\n\\\\nSetting up your store.\\\\n\\\\nYou initial startup costs.\\\\n\\\\nMarketing your dropshipping business.\\\\n\\\\nFinding Products to Dropship \\\\u2013 Identifying a Niche:\\\\n\\\\nMany dropshipping guides assert that there is a definite price point, product type, or audience you have to market to in order to be successful.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, dropshipping is ultimately all about arbitrage. You need to rely on your consumers NOT doing any price comparisons or shopping around.\\\\n\\\\nIn other words, you need to take advantage of price discrepancies between Chinese/cheap manufacturing costs and North American/European expectations of product pricing.\\\\n\\\\nWhen considering what niche you are targeting, your products should be distinctively lower in price than their competitive alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nSo When consumers see your product, they should immediately notice that you are the cheapest option they have come across for a particular good. Not so cheap as to be alarming, but cheap enough to be an obvious deal.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s my first dropshipping sale as an example:\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a hunting-themed camouflage baseball cap. I sell it for $11.76 + $10 shipping for a total of $21.76.\\\\n\\\\nThe cap costs me $7 to purchase from a Chinese manufacturer.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when my target market sees a decent quality cap that\\\\u2019s only $21.76, that is actually much cheaper than many other brand of caps or hats sold elsewhere in the world.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a great example of a good item to dropship. I can mark the price up and it still remains competitive.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you think about a niche to start your dropshipping business, think of your product list and ensure it can spark this sense of excitement and value in consumers.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, avoid products/niches that are important purchasing decisions.\\\\n\\\\nYou want consumers to see a great deal, get excited and purchase. If you sell very expensive items that require consumers to do their own research, you might have difficulty selling.\\\\n\\\\nSourcing your Dropshipping Products:\\\\n\\\\nFrom what I\\\\u2019ve read and am slowly starting to experience, there are a few guidelines for sourcing your dropshipping products:\\\\n\\\\nYou need to find reliable suppliers.\\\\n\\\\nYour products should remain (roughly) between $20-$150 once they have been marked up. You can certainly market more expensive items, but your consumers might be hesitant to spend that much money online.\\\\n\\\\nYou should be able to mark the prices of your product up by 100% to 200%.\\\\n\\\\nYou need to keep things simple. Find your niche and stick to it rather than being a Jack of all trades.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m going to use AliExpress in this example since this is where I find my products and suppliers.\\\\n\\\\nAliExpress has many cheap suppliers, a wide product variety, and the quality of some items isn\\\\u2019t bad. They also provide decent shipping rates, customer support, and are used by many other dropshipping businesses.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s how you can go about sourcing your products:\\\\n\\\\nHead to AliExpress and search for your product idea:\\\\n\\\\nIn this case, let\\\\u2019s find some more caps to sell.\\\\n\\\\nSort by free shipping and orders:\\\\n\\\\nThis will display products that have been frequently ordered and also offer free shipping\\\\n\\\\nNow, find products that:\\\\n\\\\nHave 4-5 stars.\\\\n\\\\nHave as many orders as possible (I aim for at least 50-100 orders).\\\\n\\\\nOffer ePacket shipping \\\\u2013 this is a form of shipping specifically designed for speedy and cheap eCommerce shipping.\\\\n\\\\nAre cheap enough to remain in the $20-$150 ballpark even after you mark the price up by 100% to 200%.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s an example of a product I would pick:\\\\n\\\\nIt has good reviews, plenty of orders, and it\\\\u2019s very cheap. I could easily add this hat to an army-themed clothing store and sell that hat for $15-$20.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to get more in-depth, be sure to check out additional information on the product such as:\\\\n\\\\nTheir return policy.\\\\n\\\\nIf the supplier offers tracking information.\\\\n\\\\nHow long the manufacturing/fulfillment process takes (the shorter the time, the better).\\\\n\\\\nHow their product photos look (you\\\\u2019ll need good photos for your marketing efforts).\\\\n\\\\nConduct this process several times for each product category you plan on dropshipping.\\\\n\\\\nGather a list of about 20-30 items you want to dropship just to make sure you have enough variety to launch the initial version of your store.\\\\n\\\\nYou are now ready to start your business!\\\\n\\\\nNow Setting up a Dropshipping Store:-\\\\n\\\\nPersonally, I recommend using Shopify as your dropshipping store platform.\\\\n\\\\nShopify is affordable, offers sleek designs that support eCommerce, and can implement some necessary dropshipping tools and plugins.\\\\n\\\\nShopify is also great for dropshipping because it allows you to process payments very quickly, provide customer support, and effectively manage your shop.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you can also pause your Shopify dropshipping store at any time to put your payments and storefront on hold.\\\\n\\\\nSo, there\\\\u2019s really no harm in trying out a free 14 day trial of Shopify or even paying for a month or 2 of having your own store since you can always put it on the back burner!\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have decided on your dropshipping niche, here\\\\u2019s how you can setup your storefront:\\\\n\\\\nHead over to Shopify and sign up with my link to receive a free 14 day trial!\\\\n\\\\nCreate your account and store name. Don\\\\u2019t overthink this.\\\\n\\\\nSelect a free theme to use for your storefront.\\\\n\\\\nStart importing your products with Oberlo\\\\n\\\\nHow to use Oberlo for Dropshipping:\\\\n\\\\nThere are plenty of guides on how to use Oberlo, and I\\\\u2019m not going to go very in-depth since the process is actually very simple.\\\\n\\\\nJust head to the Shopify App Store, search Oberlo, and download the app.\\\\n\\\\nThen, download the Oberlo Chrome extension.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you find a product on AliExpress you want to dropship, you can use this plugin to import the product into your Oberlo dashboard:\\\\n\\\\nThe product you want to dropship will now appear on your Oberlo product import list\\\\n\\\\nHere, you can edit your product information, price, product variants, and included images.\\\\n\\\\nAliExpress suffers from keyword stuffing and poor grammar, so be sure to do a thorough review of your information and fix any errors:\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see, I\\\\u2019ve edited how the product will appear on my store to make it more appealing/logical.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also choose your price point, as well as how great of a \\\\u2018sale\\\\u2019 your product is on for:\\\\n\\\\nIn this example, I\\\\u2019ve chosen to sell the cap for $16.10, which is also cheaper than the comparison price of $19.32 (which I randomly made up).\\\\n\\\\nWhen you are ready to publish a product to your storefront, just hit push to shop.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s all there is to it.\\\\n\\\\nHow you design your storefront and categorize your merchandise is up to you.\\\\n\\\\nChances are, you\\\\u2019ll need to play around with your shop settings to make your storefront look appealing, but this isn\\\\u2019t too difficult.\\\\n\\\\nOberlo\\\\u2019s free plan allows you to import up to 500 products. This should give you plenty of room to design a dropshipping business that can become profitable.\\\\n\\\\nSetting up a Dropshipping Store \\\\u2013 Additional Costs:-\\\\n\\\\nWhile Oberlo is free, there are 2 main expenses you must also factor in for your dropshipping business.\\\\n\\\\nFirstly, you need to buy a domain name for your website.\\\\n\\\\nIf you maintain a free Shopify store.\\\\n\\\\nThen This is simply unacceptable. You are operating a store, and you need to remain professional.\\\\n\\\\nPurchase your domain name through the Shopify dashboard. It will cost around $15-$18.\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, you need to purchase a Shopify plan.\\\\n\\\\nThe Basic Shopify plan is sufficient for starting a dropshipping business. To break even each month, you\\\\u2019ll only need to sell 1-2 products which is certainly possible.\\\\n\\\\nIf you can\\\\u2019t afford a domain name and monthly Shopify plan at the moment, I would suggest conducting your product/market research and creating content for your website (like blog posts) until you are ready to purchase.\\\\n\\\\nMy Dropshipping Strategy:\\\\n\\\\nA lot of dropshipping guides don\\\\u2019t disclose their own products, market, or progress.\\\\n\\\\nAs usual, I want to be transparent and actually teach people something. Feel free to copy my idea if you want\\\\u2026I do love a good competition!\\\\n\\\\nMy dropshipping business is Buy Hunting Gear.\\\\n\\\\nIt specializes in hunting apparel, accessories, scopes, and spotters:\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, I have about 30 products and am planning on adding more products as time goes on:\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s why I picked the hunting niche for dropshipping:\\\\n\\\\nHunting season is starting.\\\\n\\\\nHunting gear is overpriced (in my opinion) in the United States and Canada. Companies like Dick\\\\u2019s Sporting Goods practically have a monopoly on certain hunting products.\\\\n\\\\nI can mark the prices of my products up by 100% to 200% and still remain competitive.\\\\n\\\\nThere are dozens of great suppliers on AliExpress to choose from.\\\\n\\\\nThese products aren\\\\u2019t high-involvement purchases.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, I predict that sales of hunting related goods will actually increase in the future.\\\\n\\\\nAs gun laws potentially become more strict and limit the sale of semi-automatic weapons, I think the rifle market and hunting industry might see an increase in consumers who just want to shoot shit in their spare time.\\\\n\\\\nDropshipping Marketing Strategies I Use:\\\\n\\\\nLong story short, you need to use Facebook and Instagram.\\\\n\\\\nMy first sale came within 48 hours as a result of Instagram. Instagram is already generating additional traffic as well:\\\\n\\\\nI suggest creating a Business Instagram page that describes what you do, links to your website, and also has high quality pictures of your products:\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve been operating my page for 3 days, and I have gained 150+ followers by posting photos with relevant hunting hashtags, following people who like hunting related pages, and commenting on other people\\\\u2019s photos.\\\\n\\\\nI expect to slowly grow my Instagram page and eventually drive some sales from the platform.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also setup your Instagram to automatically post to Facebook when you submit a post, which effectively automates your Facebook marketing process.\\\\n\\\\nJust be sure to also set up your Facebook page to represent your business in a professional manner.\\\\n\\\\nI have also dabbled with $20 of paid advertising on Facebook, with mixed results:\\\\n\\\\nI ran a slideshow-style advertisement for some hunting caps. I targeted men in the United States and Canada between the ages of 20-50 who have liked specific pages related to hunting, such as Elk Hunting or Deer Hunting pages.\\\\n\\\\nHere are the results:\\\\n\\\\nKey Points:\\\\n\\\\nNo sales \\\\u2013 Someone has a cap in their shopping cart at the moment, but even if they purchase, I have lost money with this ad campaign.\\\\n\\\\n41 actions taken \\\\u2013 41 people interacted with the advertisement.\\\\n\\\\nMediocre relevancy score \\\\u2013 I could have refined my targeting or run a different product that appeals more to hunters.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, I am happy to have tested paid advertising. I will run 1 more advertising campaign for $20. Hopefully I can drive some sales through Facebook.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to try your hand at advertising your dropshipping business, be sure to enable Facebook Pixel Tracking before you advertise.\\\\n\\\\nThis will allow you to re-target customers who have seen your advertisements on Facebook before and visited your website, and these customers will theoretically be more likely to purchase your products.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, anticipate having to spend $50-$100 before you begin to get an understanding of what works and doesn\\\\u2019t work for your target market.\\\\n\\\\nLessons I\\\\u2019ve Learned from Dropshipping:\\\\n\\\\nYou can start dropshipping in 24-48 hours: I put in roughly 10 hours of work before launching my website.\\\\n\\\\nYou will have to A/B test: Until you get dropshipping down to a science, always split test your product choice, advertising efforts, and marketing strategies. I plan on refining my second advertising campaign to be even better.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t over prepare: You can spend months researching products to dropship, but this won\\\\u2019t drive sales. Plan and prepare, but don\\\\u2019t be afraid to pull the trigger (haha hunting jokes).\\\\n\\\\nUse coupons: Your profit margin is going to be massive, so don\\\\u2019t be afraid to create a Shopify coupon and advertise it on your Instagram/Facebook page. I have a 5% off coupon but might increase this.\\\\n\\\\nCan you Make Money Dropshipping?\\\\n\\\\nThere are plenty of dropshipping success stories that prove the best people in this business can succeed.\\\\n\\\\nPeter Koch from the website Seller At Heart has a great series on how to start a business on Amazon by purchasing products from Alibaba. He shares his own experiences, insight, and results.\\\\n\\\\nWhile this isn\\\\u2019t exactly dropshipping, it\\\\u2019s a similar concept and I highly recommend giving his series a read.\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, a retail arbitrage business model can succeed if you know how to conduct product research, find reputable sellers, and efficiently advertise to your target market.\\\\n\\\\nHow Hard is it to Start a Dropshipping Business?\\\\n\\\\nDropshipping absolutely works.\\\\n\\\\nIt is possible to start a dropshipping business with almost no startup cost and successfully scale your business through a mixture of social media promotion, SEO, and paid advertising.\\\\n\\\\nHow do I know this?\\\\n\\\\nWell, there are many dropshipping success stories, and I\\\\u2019ve seen enough companies advertising their obviously AliExpress-sourced products on Instagram (for months at a time) to know there are some big businesses out there that spend a lot on advertising\\\\u2026if they weren\\\\u2019t profitable, they wouldn\\\\u2019t realistically be advertising so heavily for months on end (unless the investors have very deep pockets).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, starting a successful dropshipping business is not easy.\\\\n\\\\nI have now realized that I was too greedy in my initial store launch for Buy Hunting Gear.\\\\n\\\\nThe dropship space is crowded; gone are the days of easy 100% profit margins on countless niches and products.\\\\n\\\\nIf I could redo my dropshipping experiment, I definitely would have lowered my margins on every single item in my store to remain competitive on pricing.\\\\n\\\\nI had dozens of customers add their products to carts or reach checkout, but only 1 person actually converted. I blame myself for underestimating just how competitive the market was and how willing people would be to shop around and compare prices.\\\\n\\\\nI think starting your own online store provides many valuable lessons, and you may even make money by starting a dropshipping business.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, you will need to put in a great deal of effort and time for several months before your store can begin to run on semi-auto pilot (and even then, if you scale, you will work).\\\\n\\\\nI currently don\\\\u2019t have an extra hour or 2 per day to focus on dropshipping, and this is ultimately why I have put the store on hold for the time being.\\\\n\\\\nI felt I owed everyone a more detailed explanation as to why this money making experiment has stopped, so there it is!\\\\n\\\\nHopefully I can take another crack at starting a dropshipping business sometime in 2019!\\\\n\\\\nIs Dropshipping Unethical?\\\\n\\\\nI grappled with this question after making my first sale.\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, all retail business models operate upon the concept of arbitrage. If they didn\\\\u2019t, no business could remain a float.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, I don\\\\u2019t think it is wrong to act as a \\\\u2018middleman\\\\u2019 and mark your products up, even if it is a 100% to 200% margin.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I think it is necessary to remain transparent with consumers.\\\\n\\\\nOn Buy Hunting Gear, I provide brand names in my product descriptions and explain that I am ordering them from a manufacturer.\\\\n\\\\nI might not plaster the fact that the products are made in China all over the website, but hey, look up the brand name of something before you purchase.\\\\n\\\\nI also outline additional information in my About and Shipping sections that explain what to expect with shipping times, how to go about returns or cancelling orders, and how customers can give feedback.\\\\n\\\\nDropshipping is a real business model. As long as you are honest and provide quality customer service, I don\\\\u2019t think there is anything wrong with this practice.\\\\n\\\\nI hope you have found this answer to be informative and useful!\\\\n\\\\nI am just getting started with dropshipping, but if this experiment works it will definitely become a new part of internet. Now the next thing to sell products online is affiliate marketing\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nAffiliate marketing\\\\n\\\\nSo How does affiliate marketing work??\\\\n\\\\nIf you are sharing any kind of tutorial with a supply list, you are leaving money on the table. And if you are linking to sites that sell the products you\\\\u2019re promoting and you\\\\u2019re not an affiliate, you\\\\u2019re really LOSING money!!\\\\n\\\\nSo Here are some common misconceptions about affiliate marketing:-\\\\n\\\\nAffiliate marketing costs my followers more money. THAT\\\\u2019S WRONG \\\\u2013 Affiliate marketing is a way for the SELLER of the item to pay you for referring a buyer to them. It doesn\\\\u2019t cost the buyer more money. The price for the buyer is the same whether they click your affiliate link or not. In fact, sometimes affiliate offers include a DISCOUNT the buyer might not otherwise receive.\\\\n\\\\nAffiliate marketing is really hard to do, with coding involved. THAT\\\\u2019S WRONG \\\\u2013 Advanced affiliate marketers use coding and specialized techniques but everyday affiliate marketers like you and me just need a unique product link with our identifier in it. The affiliate program will generate these links for you.\\\\n\\\\nSo Now, let\\\\u2019s get started with affiliate marketing:-\\\\n\\\\n1. Sign up for a program\\\\n\\\\nThe first step is to sign up for an affiliate marketing program. So I recommend Amazon because it is fast and easy to sign up and get approved. There are two basic types of affiliate programs \\\\u2013 those run directly by the company itself (Amazon runs their own in-house program) and those run by an agency . To find the affiliate program for any retailer you want work with, simply google the retailer name and \\\\u201caffiliate program\\\\u201d. Here are a few affiliate programs I use and recommend:\\\\n\\\\nA)Amazon Associates\\\\n\\\\nB)Clickbank\\\\n\\\\n2. Find links\\\\n\\\\nIn the affiliate program, find links for the products you are listing in your blog post or YouTube video (yes, you can put affiliate links on Youtube!). Check the guidelines of each affiliate marketing program to find out where links for that program are allowed to be placed. For example, some affiliate programs may not allow affiliate links in email or to be posted on social media \\\\u2013 they only want their links on blogs or websites.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\u201cback end\\\\u201d of the affiliate program website usually has multiple assets you can use to sell their products, from banner ads to sales copy and ads to product links. I typically only use product links because it\\\\u2019s simple. You can dig deeper in any of the programs to really make them work for you.\\\\n\\\\n3. Add the links to your post\\\\n\\\\nThe best place I have found for adding affiliate links in a blog post is the supply list. DIY and craft bloggers always have supply lists \\\\u2013 we want our followers to be able to recreate the project with success. By linking the supply list to the EXACT products you used, you can ensure that your followers will find the right product and have success. You can get fancy and build widgets and embed buttons and things on your site but to get started, I recommend just finding the product link and hyperlinking that product in your supply list. Since you\\\\u2019re making money from your affiliate relationship, be sure to mark the links as \\\\u201cnofollow\\\\u201d (click here to see how to do that).\\\\n\\\\nHit publish on your blog post and you\\\\u2019re ready to earn! Here\\\\u2019s a recap:\\\\n\\\\nSign up for an affiliate program for a retailer that sells what you\\\\u2019re promoting.\\\\n\\\\nFind affiliate links for the products you\\\\u2019re using in your blog post.\\\\n\\\\nAdd the links as hyperlinks to your blog posts.\\\\n\\\\nMake sure affiliate links are marked as \\\\u201cnofollow\\\\u201d in the code.\\\\n\\\\nPublish and promote your post.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Market Your Products more efficiently\\\\n\\\\nIn many ways, no matter how far we\\\\u2019ve come when it comes to technology and online selling\\\\u2026 the same principles of marketing and consumer psychology hold true. And that\\\\u2019s definitely the case with your online venture.\\\\n\\\\nThe name of the game here is direct-response marketing. Back in the day, this was done with snail mail flyers, letters, magalogs, catalogs, and other printed material. Yes, so-called \\\\u201cjunk mail.\\\\u201d But they wouldn\\\\u2019t send it out by the millions if it didn\\\\u2019t work. These days this sort of content is sent out electronically. And it still works like a charm to get customers to open their wallets.\\\\n\\\\nThe good news is that you don\\\\u2019t have to spend a ton of money when you engage in direct-response marketing online. Email marketing is a virtually free method to reach sell your products. And that will be the basis of your marketing efforts.\\\\n\\\\nThe basic idea is create a list of email subscribers. You send them both useful content \\\\u2014 free valuable information related to your product/niche, as well as offers to buy products. Sending them the free content will speed up the process of them knowing, liking, and trusting you enough to buy your paid products. The novelty of buying stuff online wore off years ago and now people have a lot to choose from \\\\u2014 you must give them a warm fuzzy feeling to be the one they buy from.\\\\n\\\\nYes, only a small percentage of people will actually respond.

       "   2: ': \"As the owner of one of London\\\\u2019s top cleaning companies, Glimmr [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk ], I think I\\\\u2019m well equipped to answer this question.\\\\n\\\\nIn today\\\\u2019s day and age, everybody enjoys a clean home, but very few have the time to properly get the job done. If they do, it usually comes at the price of other leisure activities they might have planned for themselves. Frankly, sometimes we all deserve a little break. Whether we are a high profile business woman or a stay at home dad, everyone should be able to once in a while put their feet up and let someone else do the work for a change.\\\\n\\\\nStill not convinced? Here\\\\u2019s 8 more reasons to hire a cleaning service:\\\\n\\\\n1. MORE FREE TIME\\\\n\\\\nWho doesn\\\\u2019t enjoy more free time, right? Cleaning is a chore that can demand hours of your time in order to do a thorough job. With work and other commitments taking up most of your week, you want to spend your remaining time on fun activities \\\\u2013 and for most of us, cleaning isn\\\\u2019t one of them.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\\\u2019s worse is that cleaning can sometimes be a high energy task, causing us to exert most of our energy scrubbing and washing the nooks and crannies of our home. At this point, we may find that even after investing all that time cleaning, the satisfaction of a clean home is offset by the exhaustion from the clean. This means that you might feel a lot more tired a lot less likely to take your mates up on that offer to hang out later that night.\\\\n\\\\n2. A PERSONALISED CLEANING PLAN\\\\n\\\\nA cleaning service can make a personalised cleaning plan that suits your needs. Cleaning services such as glimmr take into account your unique situation and pain points around the house before your clean and work towards making these a thing of the past. Professional cleaners are trained in a whole range of cleaning activities and are well suited for taking those pesky tasks off your hands.\\\\n\\\\n3. A WEALTH OF EXPERTISE\\\\n\\\\nMost of us might encounter a mess from time to time that we don\\\\u2019t know how to properly deal with. Issues such as limescale on your taps [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/how-to-remove-limescale-from-your-home/ ], spilt wine on your carpet [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/how-to-keep-your-carpet-clean/ ] or grime on your windows [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk/window-cleaning-101/ ] can all appear a bit daunting if you haven\\\\u2019t dealt with them before. This is where a domestic cleaner can help save the day. Experienced cleaners would\\\\u2019ve seen it all before and will be well equipped to deal with a host of situations that might seem daunting to you.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you hire a cleaning service, you are hiring professionals with a wealth of experience and expertise. For instance, at glimmr [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk ], our cleaners have been carefully vetted to ensure that only the best and most experienced cleaners make it to your front door.\\\\n\\\\n4. SECURITY AND PEACE OF MIND\\\\n\\\\nA reliable domestic cleaning service is one that doesn\\\\u2019t require you to be at home. After all, what is the benefit of more free time if it means you have to stay and watch your cleaner while they work? Using a reliable cleaning service will give you the peace of mind to leave your home, enjoy your day and come back to a beautifully clean home. Think of it a bit like room service in a hotel.\\\\n\\\\nWe think there\\\\u2019s too much living for you to do to be cooped up in your house for a couple of hours each weekend.\\\\n\\\\n5. GETTING TO THE AREAS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED\\\\n\\\\nFor some of us, cleaning can be a chore that comes out of necessity. You see a dirty home, and you feel it\\\\u2019s about time to give it a quick clean and go back to whatever you were doing before it.\\\\n\\\\nYour domestic cleaner, however, doesn\\\\u2019t see it that way. Domestic cleaners know how to maximise efficiency without compromising on quality. They can do this, because after years of cleaning, they know exactly how to and where to clean. This includes areas that most people often overlook. This means that hiring a domestic cleaning service will often result in a cleaner home than if we were to undertake the task ourselves.\\\\n\\\\n6. SPECIALISED EQUIPMENT\\\\n\\\\nA major reason for hiring a cleaning service is access to specialised equipment that you wouldn\\\\u2019t just have lying around the house. That is unless you\\\\u2019re one of the few individuals that just happens to collect these as a hobby.\\\\n\\\\nHaving access to this type of cleaning equipment as well as professionals trained to use them can help you get the type of clean that you just wouldn\\\\u2019t be able to replicate at home.\\\\n\\\\n7. YOU CAN HOST MORE NIGHTS IN\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s usually 2 main reasons most people shy away from hosting more nights in with friends. One of them is not having a clean enough home to host others in and another is a fear of the effort it would take to clean up after our guests leave.\\\\n\\\\nEither way, there\\\\u2019s one common factor in both these cases and it has to do with cleaning our home \\\\u2013 or not wanting to. But it doesn\\\\u2019t have to be so! Hiring a regular cleaning service can ensure that your home is clean throughout the week and you can have more hassle free nights in with those that matter.\\\\n\\\\n8. LESS FIGHTS WITH YOUR PARTNER\\\\n\\\\nNow fights with a partner over cleaning are something that affect nearly us all. These can stem from forgetting to clean a plate that was meant to be cleaned or not cleaning up to the standard of our significant other. Wouldn\\\\u2019t it be great if this task could be handed over to someone else? (No, we don\\\\u2019t mean your partner. That\\\\u2019s what got you into this mess to begin with.)\\\\n\\\\nYou guessed it \\\\u2013 a regular cleaning service can take this problem off both you and your partner\\\\u2019s shoulders. This way, you can stop the bickering and get back to the romance that brought you two love birds together in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nSUMMING IT UP\\\\n\\\\nI could go on with all the benefits of hiring a cleaning service, but you get the point.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to a cleaner home, what we usually want when we hire domestic cleaners is more time back in our lives. Each moment you are not spending on cleaning, you can spend on tasks that fulfil you or with people that you cherish.\", \"',\n",

Several states and provinces could also be considering opening businesses or relaxing strict stay-at-home mandates also . this might mean employers are finding ways to stay a clean environment for his or her employees if/when they are available back to the office. When brooding about hiring a cleaning business or individual cleaning person, consider the subsequent tips.\\\\n\\\\n1. Research the corporate . Ask friends, relations , and neighbors to recommend a reputable cleaning business or individual. It\\\\u2019s an honest practice to interview a minimum of three companies to urge an estimate before selecting one to rent . inspect\\\\n\\\\nthe companies through to read reviews or complaints on them. watch out for businesses with poor reviews and multiple complaints, more importantly, see how they address them.\\\\n\\\\n2. Interview candidates. Interview multiple candid\\\\n\\\\nates to work out if you\\'d\\\\n\\\\nlike better to hire an outsized cleaning business or a private cleaning person. Request to satisfy with someone from the cleaning business, also\\\\n\\\\nlike the one that will actually clean your home or office. During the interview process, determine if you\\'d be comfortable with them since they\\'re going to be in your home or office. Ask what sort of cleaning products are used, especially if there are family or employees which will be sensitive to harsh chemicals.\\\\n\\\\n3. Check credentials. a person or business that\\'s considered for hire should be bonded and insured. this may protect your company and family within the event something is broken, stolen, or if someone gets injured on the work . Whether you hire a private or a business, request that the workers working in your home have a background check done, otherwise you\\\\n\\\\nmight want\\\\n\\\\nto finish one on them yourself for peace of mind.\\\\n\\\\n4. Request references. Before making a suggestion , ask that the business or individual provide an inventory of references you\\'ll contact. When speaking with the references, search for a business or person who has repeat satisfied customers. Ask the references about the services they use and if the business met expectations.\\\\n\\\\n5. Discuss cost. Determine the length of your time the cleaning service is important . determine exactly what\\'s included in their services and confirm it encompasses everything you would like\\\\n\\\\nto possess cleaned. If you would like something specific, communicate that up front therefore the cleaning company is ready to accommodate your request. The representative should rehearse your home or office before providing an estimate. Ask if the cleaning business provides their own cleaning supplies, if not the value of the services should be less costly . confine mind the smallest amount expensive cleaning services might not be supplying you with\\\\n\\\\nthe simplest deal for your money.\\\\n\\\\n6. Get everything in writing. When making a final judgment , review the agreement that spells out clearly what the cleaners will do and therefore the time frame during which\\\\n\\\\nit\\'ll be completed.\\\\n\\\\n7. steel oneself against the services. Before the cleaning service arrives, secure all personal items like jewelry, documents with private information thereon , and other valuables. Make arrangements for pets so it\\\\u2019s less stressful for them and for the cleaning crew.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cLicensed, bonded and insured\\\\u201d are important when having any sort of work wiped out a home or office.

This mindset becomes seductive, drawing us further into a life of inertia. I get that way sometimes, too.\\\\n\\\\nA hundred years ago, unless you were wealthy and had servants, you were more inclined to get on with home tasks and not mope about them. You weren\\\\u2019t thrilled to clean the house, but you were proud when you finished, and didn\\\\u2019t really think about it as a useless cycle. It was simply part of what you did in order to maintain a healthy and happy family and friendships.\\\\n\\\\nSo, what should you do to make it easier to clean and be less mopey about it? Tell you what I do: 1) I keep my home NEAT. This is a MAJOR factor in keeping away the depression I am prone to. And, if a new object comes into the house, something else must leave. 2) I listen to music as I dust, clean the toilets, wash the tub and change the bed linens. 3) I can\\\\u2019t listen to music when I\\\\u2019m vacuuming, so after I vacuum a room, I reward myself with some TV or music time. 4) I keep thinking that I\\\\u2019m making my home healthier as I clean. 5) I keep thinking about the compliments I get on how nice my home looks. That means I am making others happy.\\\\n\\\\nSome people clean a room every couple of days. I deep clean everything once a month. No matter how you do it, it boils down to two things: Keep it neat and organized, and develop a philosophy of personal gratitude that you have friends, family, and YOURSELF to clean for.\", \"',\n",
       "   2: ': \"How do I keep my room clean? I\\\\u2019m 19 and I could never keep it clean for more than a week.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a difference between dirty and messy. Dirty requires cleaning. Messy requires organization. More likely than not, most of your issue is messiness and that is a fairly simple fix that will actually last and make your room easier to clean.\\\\n\\\\nSo how do you do that? Well, your room will likely need to be decluttered and organized and that will require making your room even messier before you will get it clean. First, pick an area of your room you want to declutter and organize. Let\\\\u2019s go with your closet first. Make your bed (trust me) and then take everything out of your closet (yes, everything) and put it on your bed. Go into your closet and clean all of the surfaces, including the rod, any shelving, and the floor. Go through each and every single thing and either put it back in the closet neatly or put it aside for either throwing away or donating. I recommend organizing your clothing in the closet in a way that makes sense to you. For me, that means that all of my tops are on the left of the closet, my bottoms are in the middle, and dresses are on the right with outwear like jackets, sweaters, and coats on the far right. Each article of clothing are further organized by length (short to long sleeve, short to long skirts and pants, short to long dresses, and progressively heavier weight outerwear). Same would go for shoes (say from casual shoes to dressy and then boots). And then whatever else you keep in your closet.\\\\n\\\\nWhen the closet is completely done and your bed no longer has stuff on it, you can move on to your dresser. Empty the whole thing and get rid of what you don\\\\u2019t want and fold and store what you do. Clean each drawer out with a soft cloth and cleaning solution. I recommend learning to fold so that you can use the file method of placing your clothes in your drawers. It saves space so you can fit more in your drawers and so that you can find what you\\\\u2019re looking for without having to look under other things and make a mess of your drawers. Here\\\\u2019s a video for that:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmNXyyd9FWk\\\\nOnce your dresser is full, you would move onto whatever other spaces you have in your room (desk, nightstands, bookcases) and do the same until your entire space is decluttered and organized. Empty, clean the area, decide what to keep and what to get rid of, put it all back in an organized way.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\\\u2019re putting things back, do your best to put them back in a specific way, giving everything you own a specific place where it lives. This is important. When you use things, you will be able to find where it is. Once you\\\\u2019re finished using it, put it back exactly where you got from immediately. If things don\\\\u2019t have an official home, then you will leave them just wherever and that is what makes your room messy. Make your bed every morning. Don\\\\u2019t leave dirty clothes on the floor, put them in a hamper or basket. When you do your laundry, fold or hang everything immediately after you finish and put them away. If you take a shirt off a hanger, put it on and then decide it isn\\\\u2019t what you want to wear, hang it back up immediately. Doing things as you go and not procrastinating is what keeps your room clean and keeps you from having to spend an entire day cleaning and organizing your space every week. Once a week, all you should have to do is dust, change your sheets (or wash and put them back on if you only have one set), do your laundry, and then do your floors. Why? Because you put everything back where it goes every day as you used it so you don\\\\u2019t need to declutter and organize. And if you spot clean as you see a mess (say you spilled a drink on your end table), you will not have to even worry about cleaning so much.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"It would appear that you have built up some kind of mental block about fixing this problem you have, and it is actively preventing you from being able to get to work on solving it.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\'s okay. Take a deep breath. As others have suggested, you are probably just overwhelmed. It\\'s a mental thing. Interestingly enough, clutter itself can cause you to feel discouraged to the point where you feel physically incapable of dealing with it. It sounds almost comical, but you are basically in a battle of wits between yourself and your mess.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re better than your mess. You can do this. You just need a strategy.\\\\n\\\\nYou may be surprised to find that cutting corners is perfectly acceptable and will contribute to your overall productivity. Give yourself permission to cheat. It is surprisingly satisfying.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll give you a simple rule to follow that will help you find a place to start and keep you focused throughout the process: Start at the top and work your way down.\\\\n\\\\nTurn on some upbeat music or call a relative long distance (pro tip: mothers and sisters are great for this). You will be focusing 90% of your attention on something else while the remaining 10% picks up. (Pro tip: refer to cleaning as \\\\u201cpicking up\\\\u201d as it sounds much less soul devouringly involved and tedious. I\\'m not cleaning, that takes hours. I\\'m just picking up real quick, you nincompoop).\\\\n\\\\nTaking it from the top: This doesn\\'t mean you have to mop the ceiling or anything. It doesn\\'t even mean you need to dust your ceiling fan blades. That is some next level shit. We\\'re operating on a solid Level One right now. Look down a little lower.\\\\n\\\\nAhh, surfaces. A great starting point. Grab two laundry baskets (empty ones) and toss trash into one, misplaced items into the other. Do not think about where the misplaced items are supposed to go. That is a dark downward spiral waiting to happen. You must focus. Two categories: Trash, and This Doesn\\'t Go Here. You can do this.\\\\n\\\\nRepeat this process on all the surfaces in your bedroom, taking breaks between each one if necessary. Logically there should really only be a few surfaces. Your bed, dresser, maybe a nightstand and/or a desk. This will probably take 15 minutes max. Stash the basket full of miscellaneous objects out of sight and set the one containing trash in the kitchen or garage or wherever your household\\'s Main Trashcan (you know the one) is located.\\\\n\\\\nThen, take a break. Do not time your break. Do not clock yourself. Just take a break and then get back to work when you feel okay with doing that.\\\\n\\\\nNext: floor. Repeat the exact same method on your bedroom floor, but add in one more laundry basket to toss clothes into. Again, much like the misc stuff basket, don\\'t sort the clothes into multiple categories (darks, whites, delicates, etc). It will only frighten you and make you cry. Not that I would know that from experience or anything.\\\\n\\\\nStep\\\\u2026now: Break time! Indulge in something you love (carbs, anyone?) and marvel at the novelty of your newly unfucked room.\\\\n\\\\nGrab your baskets out of hiding. Not the clothes basket or the trash baskets. Just the misc baskets. There should be two of them. One from clearing your surfaces, the other from clearing the floor. One, two. Two is a very manageable number. If you disagree, place one of the baskets out of view and work on one at a time.\\\\n\\\\nIt is a good idea to do the worst basket first to get it out of the way. If you simply cannot handle that, though, which is fine too by the way, work on the least intimidating basket first. The fact that you\\'ve confined your mess to two baskets means you\\'ve already won the war. This will be a fucking cake walk.\\\\n\\\\nPut your things away. Books go on your bookshelf. They don\\'t have to be in alphabetical order. As long as you\\'re getting the book onto the bookshelf, you my friend are getting the job done. Dirty dishes go into the kitchen sink. Those pens go into a cup on your desk. You get the idea.\\\\n\\\\nBreak (optional).\\\\n\\\\nDo your other misc basket.\\\\n\\\\nBreak (optional).\\\\n\\\\nClothes basket: Question: Are these clean or dirty? Answer: Fuggit, they\\'ve been on the floor, I have walked on them; therefore, everything is dirty. Sort by color. Literally. Whites in one pile, colors (aka everything else) into another pile. Then go through the colors and further break them down into darks (generally: blacks, blues, grays, etc) and brights (yellows, reds, oranges, etc). In other words, you know how the tag on some clothing items will tell you to wash with \\\\u201clike colors\\\\u201d ? Obey it. Obey the tag.\\\\n\\\\nToss your first load of laundry into the washer and go to your trash baskets. Dump them into the trash can/dumpster. I would suggest rinsing the baskets out afterwards but hey this is a free country and that\\'s totally up to you. Stack empty baskets together and store them wherever you store them. In your room or in the linen closet or on a shelf in the laundry room. I don\\'t know where your laundry baskets go. I don\\'t know your life. I don\\'t know what you\\'ve been through.\\\\n\\\\nNow you should have a room that is free of trash, laundry, and miscellaneous items sitting everywhere. This will probably be enough to inspire you to keep going. Progress begets progressing.\\\\n\\\\nSprinkle carpet freshener (if applicable) and leave it for now. Wipe down surfaces. Dust. Windex your mirror, it has hairspray all over it. Dust your windowsills and the drapes, they\\'re embarrassing. Polish picture frames and sanitize doorknobs and lightswitches. Do this while wearing a surgeons mask over your mouth and nose if you have allergies.\\\\n\\\\nVacuum. Use the hose extension to get into nooks and crannies.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\'re done, it will amaze you to discover that you\\'ll probably be incapable of stopping yourself from looking for more things to clean/organize. Feel free to go all out.\\\\n\\\\nCleaning your room will make you feel as if you have cleaned your entire life. You owe it to yourself to get started.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re the only one who has to live with not doing it.\\\\n\\\\nI believe in you.\", \"',\n",
       "   4: ': \"I did a deep room clean but it still feels messy. What are some things/organization tricks I can do to make my room feel tidy?\\\\n\\\\nSo there is a difference between cleaning and organizing. If you actually both cleaned and organized, there may be other things you didn\\\\u2019t consider regarding what could make your room feel messy. One would be making your bed every day. Another would be making sure that everything not in use should be in the space you designated for it. If it doesn\\\\u2019t have a designated space, you need to make one for it (and everything else that doesn\\\\u2019t have a permanent space). How much stuff is still sitting on open surfaces like end tables, dresser, desk, shelving? How much stuff is on the floor? How much stuff is on the bed? Limiting the things that are openly visible in your room can give your eyes a place to rest instead of your eyes being overwhelmed by the things that it sees in your space. So if something doesn\\\\u2019t actually belong out in the open, you should find a space for it that is more hidden. For example, if you keep all of your stuffed animals on your bed and you can\\\\u2019t limit the number you own or aren\\\\u2019t willing to get rid of some of them, you need to consider another way to store them than on your bed. If you have a lot of office tools on your desk, you may want to consider getting organizers to hold them in. I have this great tea box set that I keep rubber bands, binder clips, and paper clips in. There are three cylinder boxes with lids and they fit into a rectangular box with a lid. I keep the lids for the cylinders closed and the boxes are pretty and I don\\\\u2019t see the messiness of desk clutter. Other ideas include an additional set of drawers, possibly a cart, for all of the office supplies that don\\\\u2019t fit in your desk and are creating a mess on your desk. Ideally, you would only have your computer, small storage containers with lids, and maybe a pencil holder on your desk and everything else. All paper, file folders, magazines, tape dispenser, stapler, staples, etc, would be neatly organized in drawers.\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \"Differences:\\\\n\\\\nTurpentine accelerates the drying time faster than most paint thinners or mineral spirits among other things because it accelerates the polymerization of the oil film since it incorporates oxygen into the mix oxidizing the paint layer from the inside out .\\\\n\\\\nTurpentine can soften the previous layers of paint because it is a very powerful solvent. Oil paints become insoluble to most solvents after 6 month of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. OMS or odorless mineral spirits are petroleum based mild solvent that do not alter the previous layer when you are doing glazes.\\\\n\\\\nTurpentine is more toxic among other things because it evaporates faster creating a concentration of organic volatile compounds.\\\\n\\\\nNeighbors tend to complain more about the smell of turpentine that the petroleum derivates solvents. OMS odorless mineral spirits (Gamsol) has a very faint smell that is hard to notice at least by the neighbors. Which is a pro and a con at the same time when you are painting indoors since you will not notice the smell. But that does not mean that organic volatile compounds are not accumulating in your room and poisoning you. You are just not as aware.\\\\n\\\\nTurpentine dissolves dammar resins which make good removable protective traditional varnish that should be applied after 6 months so that the paint becomes insoluble to the turpentine in the varnish. Petroleum based paint thinners, being a weak solvent do not dissolve dammar resins, but they can be used in synthetic removable varnish like soluvar that according to the manufacturer can be applied as soon as the paint film is dry to the touch. Those same petroleum base solvents can be used to remove said varnish (Soluvar) when required.\\\\n\\\\nYou can do oil painting without solvents or at least minimize the use of toxic solvents emitting nasty fumes and bothering people nearby.\\\\n\\\\n1. Mix colors using spatula, or palette knife which creates cleaner mixes and cleans faster than a paint brush.\\\\n2. Paint using spatula. Easier to clean.\\\\n3. Work oil painting in a paste consistency instead of fluid.\\\\n4. Use artist quality paints that are highly pigmented with no fillers.\\\\n5. Use walnut oil as a more fluid oil for the details.\\\\n6. The classic term \\\\u201cFat over Lean\\\\u201d means to add more fluid oil (\\\\u201cFat\\\\u201d) on the final details. It also means to start with a lean paint, a paint with less oil which would have a thicker consistency and should be applied with hard bristles brushes. But it also means slow drying over fast drying. Oil paints dry at different rates according to the kind of pigment in their formula, the kind of oil they use (poppy seed oil, walnut oil, linseed or flax seed oil and the pigment load. You may have to increase the pigment load of some paints by either adding powdered pigments or removing oil out of them by letting them rest for some time on a piece of adsorbent paper.\\\\n7. For the foundation layers use paints that contain fast drying pigments like umbers, and most earths. Apply them very thinly, and with a higher pigment to oil ratio. Leave the slow drying pigments (usually most reds) for the final layers. Some light and cool color like Titanium White take longer to dry among other things because they use a slower drying oil like poppyseed oil.\\\\n8. If you paint in one session or wet on wet you will also benefit from painting fat over lean. Or in this case more fluid over more solid. All because a fluid oily layer of paint applied with a soft brush with a gentle touch have less chance to perturb the previous lean almost solid layer.\\\\n9. It is Oil paint, not solvent paint, and no enamel paint. Avoid solvents as much as you can. Wipe the brushes with a rag, use different brushes for the dark and light colors. At the end of the session you can keep the brushes on an inclined tray with some walnut oil to keep the hairs wet and ready for next day without a need to wash them. For a longer time of storage, wipe the brushes with a rag or paper towel and then wash them with soap and water.\\\\n10. If for any reason you need a fluid effect like in watercolors, use a water based underpainting with fluid acrylics or airbrush acrylics. Oil paint consistency is supposed to be oily (fatty) not watery. Any solvent addition damages the structural integrity of the paint layer.\\\\n11. Do no let the brushes dry with paint. If that happens the best solvent to restore the brushes is essential oil of lavender or rosemary .\\\\n12. If wet paint lands on your skin you can wet a rag in any vegetable oil and clean it. No need for solvent that gets absorbed by your skin.\\\\n\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"Both of these can be added to paint to make it more fluid. Turpentine is a solvent and thins paint by breaking down the binders in oil paint. Solvent thinned layers should be the first layers of an oil painting. They are going to dry quickly as the solvent evaporates. I no longer use turpentine because I don\\\\u2019t like the toxic and volatile chemicals it contains. I use odorless mineral spirits instead. Linseed oil is a fatty substance that can be mixed with paint to thin the texture and add gloss. Following the painting practice of fat over lean means that linseed oil thinned paint will dry slowly and polymerize as it dries, so it should be used only in the top layers of a painting.\", \"',\n",

That\\'s why it is so demonized, because the fumes really can get intense.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s hard to ignore the positives though. One-those crazy fumes mean your paint dries really fast which is great for starting a painting. You can use turpentine washes and by the time you are done laying down the rough outlines and shapes it\\'s usually dry enough to paint over. It also contributes to a more durable paint film as it is naturally gummy and flexible. If you let a can evaporate completely their will be gummy residue leftover. Other solvents disappear like water.\\\\n\\\\nI use it and am careful because there isn\\'t really a choice unless you want pretty bad sinus type headaches from breathing fumes. Put down a wash with mineral spirits and good luck-it won\\'t even show evidence of starting to dry after 3 days. That stuff is sneaky too. You forget the fumes and wind up with the same headaches because you can\\'t smell it turpentine really smells and that increases the more you spread it out.

In fact, ones that do so cause bacterial resistant strains to develop and ordinary soaps, which kill bacteria even better, DON\\'T cause resistant strains to develop.\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Antibiotics work not by immediately destroying the bacterium, but by interfering with some part of its metabolic processes. Since bacteria are different types of cells than human cells, that interference wouldn\\'t be expected to damage the surrounding human cells in a person\\'s body. Antibiotics are safe to take internally, without killing the patient.\\\\n\\\\nAntiseptics, cannot be used internally, because they rip open cell walls. Any cell walls, yours, bacteria\\'s, plants, animals, etc. They kill. So the cells aren\\'t alive to develop resistance. Soaps are naturally antiseptic, and have been tinkered with for centuries to be less harsh in human skin if rinsed off, but still would be deadly if taken internally. But, because they don\\'t allow the pathogens to develop resistance, soap and water is the cheapest and best disinfectant we have.\\\\n\\\\nSo wash your fridge I side and out using hot soapy water, then rinse with fresh water with a different clean cloth, then dry with a clean towel. Throw all three into the wash before you use them again.\\\\n\\\\nFor surfaces in the house that water isn\\'t a good idea for (wood, painted plaster walls, etc) use a commercial disinfectant safe for that surface.

How do you make the right choice?\\\\n\\\\nHere are my five tips to get the service that\\\\u2019s right for you.\\\\n\\\\n1) Ask around\\\\n\\\\u2013 The best cleaning companies are small businesses, and small businesses thrive on word of mouth. A dependence on word of mouth necessitates a dedication to a job well done as well as top notch customer service. Who do your friends, families, and colleagues trust to clean for them?\\\\n\\\\n2) Research online\\\\n\\\\u2013 Look for companies who are well reviewed on Google, Facebook, Yelp, etc\\\\u2026 But don\\\\u2019t just look at the stars a company has been awarded, read reviews. Do the positive comments align with your own expectations? Are the negative comments fair?\\\\n\\\\n3) Call around\\\\n\\\\u2013 Do you feel like the person who answered the phone is attentive? Are they empathetic? Likable? Your home is a sacred place and cleaners are oftentimes invited into private corners not even best friends or family see. If you don\\\\u2019t feel listened to, understood, or you flat out don\\\\u2019t like the person on the phone, don\\\\u2019t bother inviting them into your home.\\\\n\\\\n4) Ask for a free estimate\\\\n\\\\u2013 Everyone has their own personal habits, beliefs, quirks, and challenges, so no two living spaces are the same, and no two sets of personal expectations are either. Make sure that if you are on a budget or have any concerns to address, you ask for a representative of the cleaning company to provide you a free estimate or quote. If taking you on as a client is important to them, they\\\\u2019ll invest the time to meet with you and earn your trust as well as your business.\\\\n\\\\n5) Demand a guarantee\\\\n\\\\u2013 No one\\\\u2019s perfect. That\\\\u2019s fine, most of us can live with that. What you shouldn\\\\u2019t live with, however, is a job not done to your standards. Any cleaner who takes pride in their work and values your business, word of mouth, and ability to type up a Google review, will at least come back to see why you\\\\u2019re not satisfied with their work. If they can do a better job, they should.\", \"',\n",

I had a female friend, A, who I knew from the 1st semester. We had grown very close to each other over time. So close that she was someone in front of whom I could be completely myself without being judged and she used to consider me her human diary. She used to tell me everything..her bad breakups, about her friends and family, everything. We were each other\\'s safe space.\\\\n\\\\nNow, what happened was last year in August, she went on an industrial visit with her classmates (we are in different departments). Around that time, I started noticing that a new guy was appearing in her social media. I was like.. nice, she\\'s got a new boyfriend :) but was also disappointed that she didn\\'t tell me first\\\\u2026that I had to know it from her social media. Still it was fine by me as she was happy. Now, obviously, she was smitten with him but after she came back from industrial visit, we hardly talked. Our conversations were never the same as before. I tried to initiate any conversation but it just wouldn\\'t happen. Still, I was fine. I know what happens during the honeymoon period. So, okay. Now, I tried staying okay but gradually I started getting angry at both of them. Him, for stealing away my friend and her, for not making any effort to talk to me.\\\\n\\\\nNow, things came to a head for me on my birthday. On the eve of my birthday, I told her to keep her afternoon free because I would treating her and my friends at a restaurant. At first she didn\\'t understand why but after sometime she understood why. After a couple of hours of this happening, she messaged me asking whether she could bring someone to meet me at the restaurant. I point blank told her no as I wanted that lunch to be about me(I didn\\'t tell her this) and also told her that I knew she was talking about her new boyfriend. She agreed. Next day, when I reached there with my friends, I saw her boyfriend\\'s bike. Immediately I knew that she did bring him here, despite me telling her no. After going in, she introduced me to him, I acted my courteous best and then started looking for our table. She saw him off and then joined us. But by then I was irritated and pissed off. While ordering, she understood this and asked me what was wrong with me but I didn\\'t tell her at that time as I didn\\'t want the mood to get spoiled. I just let that go and enjoyed my birthday lunch.\\\\n\\\\nNow over time our conversation has lessened to such an extent that we don\\'t even tag each other in Avengers related stuff( we both are huge Marvel fans). Any long conversation is out of the question. Even if we see each other in campus, it\\'s \\\\u201cHi\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cI\\'m late for class\\\\u201d, \\\\u201cBye\\\\u201d. But since all that, I have gradually made peace with the fact that we may never go back to being such good friends.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let\\'s jump to today.\\\\n\\\\nToday, in the morning, I was in line for the lift to go to my class when I saw a girl talking to a security guard who was managing the lines. Immediately I knew it was her. I caught bits of her conversation with the guard and understood that she wanted the guard to hold some assignment of her bf\\'s so that her bf could come and pick it up. I could clearly see that she was agitated as she was also getting late for her class but this was important to her (PS: she hadn\\'t seen me there).I thought of approaching her and holding the assignment for her bf, so that she could go to her class assured that the assignment will be in safe hands and will eventually reach her bf. But, I did not do so. My ego just wouldn\\'t let me. So I let it pass.\\\\n\\\\nBut as soon as I climbed into the lift, I was filled with regret.\\\\n\\\\nMaybe if I had done that, it would have been the spark to rekindle our friendship. Maybe, she would have missed me and our friendship. I don\\'t know exactly what would have happened, but I do regret not helping out a dear friend just because I was angry at her.\\\\n\\\\nThis forced me to make a promise to myself. The next time I get an similar opportunity with regards to anyone, I will be doing so without any hesitation. I cannot let my anger or ego get the better of me. Never ever again.\\\\n\\\\nThank you so much for reading this patiently. Do forgive me if there are any mistakes in there.\", \"',\n",

You will stay at home and enjoy like a queen\\\\u201d\\\\nInference : Dear girls if you are naive like me then your boyfriend will give you thousands of explanations why he wants you to follow his advice. Please never trust the \\\\u2018x\\\\u2019 amount of pocket money after marriage. That\\\\u2019s just a lie even if that amount is just 10% of his salary. Chances are you might not even get a single penny. In some cases finances are controlled by mother in law and she is the one to decide whether a husband can spend on his wife or not. So please never give up your career for the sake of marriage. One more thing, if you really want to oblige then please note that life of a housewife can mean life without career as well as life without children. Unfortunately Infertility can happen to anyone.\\\\n\\\\n2. A few days before marriage he told me to practice calling him \\\\u2018Aap\\\\u2019 instead of \\\\u2018Tum\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nI told him,\\\\u201dWe have been friends for so many years, how can I suddenly start calling you \\\\u2018aap\\\\u2019 after marriage? It\\\\u2019s very difficult for me and it will change our relationship.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nHe said \\\\u201cDoesn\\\\u2019t your mom call your dad \\\\u2018aap\\\\u2019. Majority of Indian women follow this so what is the problem? The thing is that it\\\\u2019s not about me. I don\\\\u2019t want anyone in my family to say that I married a girl who does not give respect to traditional values. I just want everybody to respect you.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n[Image Source : Google]\\\\n\\\\nInference : Dear girls this flag clearly indicates that you are dating a narcissist and there will be no way to make him understand your feelings. He will somehow convince you to believe that everything is your fault and you are not doing enough for your marriage. Run away from him before he makes you feel guilty because the more you give him time the more trapped you will become. Trust me from \\\\u2018tum khao\\\\u2019 to \\\\u2018aap khaiye\\\\u2019 everything changed for the worse in my marriage.\\\\n\\\\n3. My father in law was from a village but settled in a city after marriage. He had been brought up in a very different environment and I never paid attention to this point just because he was well educated.\\\\n\\\\nInference : Dear girls even if everybody is well educated in your in-laws family then still that house can follow certain backward customs if either of in-laws have been born and brought up in a village. Sometimes good education does not change the mindset of a family and that family can follow a very strict misogynistic attitude. Your husband will resemble his parents in many ways so do not take this lightly.\\\\n\\\\n4. Before getting married we both decided not to spend on unnecessary things at first due to financial issues. Buying a bed seemed expensive so we decided just to buy a mattress and sleep on the floor. My husband bought a mattress according to the size of the bed of his parent\\\\u2019s bedroom. He called me and said,\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201dLook my mom told me to buy a mattress of a particular size and I have already placed the order\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nMe : What do you mean?\\\\n\\\\nHe : The mattress of my mom\\\\u2019s bedroom is becoming old. She just wants that when dad will accept us in a couple of weeks then that new mattress should be placed in her bedroom.\\\\n\\\\nMe : How ridiculous! Don\\\\u2019t you think this is odd?\\\\n\\\\nHe : What is odd? She just wants our mattress to go in her room.\\\\n\\\\nMe : It\\\\u2019s really very strange. It\\\\u2019s not that she is not thinking about me. I understand she is behaving like a typical mother in law. It\\\\u2019s just that I\\\\u2019m wondering if she is not even thinking about you.\\\\n\\\\n[Image Source : Canva]\\\\n\\\\nInference : Dear girls if your boyfriend loves and respects the words of his mom beyond limits he will be ready to sacrifice his worth as well as your own worth at any cost just to make her happy. Beware of \\\\u2018Mamma\\\\u2019s boy\\\\u2019. I used to think a person who loves and respects his parents will also love his wife. I was wrong. It was just a mattress and fighting for it seemed so worthless. Now I know I should have given importance to that thing more than our love. After his dad accepted us, everything went as planned and we were given a bed with an old rotten mattress while I had to watch my in-laws sleeping peacefully on our sacrifice.\\\\n\\\\n5. This is the last red flag but in fact the biggest one. I don\\\\u2019t know how I missed this. My ex told me a family secret and warned me never to tell my family anything about it. \\\\u2018Someone\\\\u2019 in his family forcefully made \\\\u2018someone\\\\u2019 divorce his wife because they had a love marriage. It was a matter of honor and love marriage was considered evil. I will not tell who that person is because I promised him to protect that secret.\\\\n\\\\nInference : Dear girls if love marriage is considered evil in a family then please avoid staying in a joint family. Good qualities and work can melt the in-laws\\\\u2019 heart only in movies not in real life. Simply do not marry or just divorce your husband if he is not willing to live separately with you.\\\\n\\\\nEverytime I had any issues, my husband said the same thing over and over again to convince me, \\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s not worth fighting with parents. We will soon relocate to the USA. Have patience just for a few more days then I will give you a perfect life. \\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe Issues never stopped, Perfect Life never happened. So please don\\\\u2019t ignore the red flags like me.\\\\n\\\\n[Image Source : Canva]\\\\n\\\\nThe reason why my marriage of 6 years failed despite my sacrifices and compromises:\\\\n\\\\nRitu Sharma\\'s answer to Do you regret your marriage, and why?

Really ?\\\\n\\\\nI have often heard his , - a friend in a need is a friend indeed & hard times reveal your true friends . So this was it , I got reminded of all the things I have done for him be it his happy times or sorrow . But he doesn\\'t have an inch of emotion for a person whom he claims to love for eternity .

After all the collective things I could recall and was holding onto all these years came to the end .\\\\n\\\\nEnough of expectations ,Enough of disrespect ,Enough of emotional torture,Enough of his selfish attitude & Enough of him taking me for granted .\\\\n\\\\nAnd for last time I decided to walk away and never returned back .\\\\n\\\\nHad it been still the same , I wouldn\\'t be able to pursue my career and my life would have been like a jail where I\\\\u2019d be forced to do this and that as per his and his family wishes with a typical mentality of some specific category of our Indian society for whom marriage is just another business deal and a girl is not allowed to go out and expected to bear the tortures because she is a girl .\\\\n\\\\nIt was the best decision I took and regretted not taking it back there when I ignored my mind to give him chances to change his attitude.\\\\n\\\\nThings started getting better then.

The short answer is \\\\u2018Maybe\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ll explain.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we have multiple explosive charges we link them with Detonation Cord. It comes in various colors, ours is yellow. It is basically skipping rope with plastic explosive inside. \\\\nIt\\\\u2019s detonation wave is 3 THOUSAND meters per second. \\\\nFor all practical, non-nuclear, purposes, it is instantaneous. \\\\nWe used to calculate how long it would take det cord to be detonated in the Atlantic to reach the Pacific oceans. We\\\\u2019re talking minutes.\\\\nIt is also more stable than det caps.\\\\nYou can tie it into knots, hang it off bridges, cut it, hit it etc without risk of detonation.\\\\nDet caps have gone off because of direct sunlight.\\\\n\\\\nWhen we \\\\u2018wire a bridge up for detonation, we can leave it in place for days. Usually we take the C4 out, but leave the det cord in place. We must practice and know the exact time it takes us to go from one prep stage to the next. We only use one blasting cap to set it all off. (We have multiple locations to do it. Each with it\\\\u2019s own blasting cap, but we only need one spot to work.)\\\\nSo as a practical matter, the answer to your question is \\\\u2018NO\\\\u2019.\\\\n\\\\nNow in urban explosive breaching, when calculating safety distances you add in the det caps and the length of det cord. If you have dual ignition systems, you have a longer safety distance. So yes, multiple det caps adds to the total power of the explosive. However this distance is about a foot.\\\\nSo in theory, the answer to your question is Yes.\", \"',\n",

The only possible way that can happen is if you puncture your lungs so bad that they start filling up and you can\\\\u2019t breathe, and you\\\\u2019ll soon be dead of suffocation.

Whenever an organ bleeds, the blood generally falls inside this bag until the source of the bleeding is clotted.

It remains dormant in most cases after initial infection, and somewhere between ten and twenty percent of people who are affected by it get it again later in life. However, it is a DNA virus, that is, its replicatory information is encoded in DNA rather than RNA. DNA is much more difficult to mutate than RNA because it has self-checking properties related to its structure and complimentary base pairing. In addition, once a DNA virus infects and animal cell, enzymes and proteins in the cell normally used to repair the cell\\\\u2019s open DNA may repair the virus\\\\u2019 DNA as well.\\\\n\\\\nOn the contrary, influenza (flu) viruses, of which there are many types, are RNA viruses, which unlike DNA mutate rapidly and unpredictably. This means that every individual gets a slightly different version of the flu when they get sick, and over the course of passing through the population, the virus tends to mutate enough that your immune system no longer recognizes it as the same virus. Because the structure of RNA is not self-checking, like DNA is, when the virus\\\\u2019 genetic material is copied in animal cell, mistakes will be made and not corrected, resulting in both non-viable and mutated versions of the same virus.\\\\n\\\\nYou can think of DNA viruses like a mob of identical humans attacking a house, your body (the house) quickly learns what they look like and keep a look out forever. RNA viruses, on the other hand, are like a mob of humans attacking your house.

His parents are divorced and they all do everything for him to compensate for a broken family, somehow. So, when I became part of his life, I put work schedule at home right away. Each of us take turns on doing dishes, cleaning, doing laundry and even cooking. Rightfully, as he is still young I only put him on cooking duty once a week. I am there teaching him new recipes and teaching him how to wash dishes efficiently. We just recently acquired dishwasher, so we hand wash everything before. As he get older I added more choires for him. At 12, I gave him a choice to either do laundry with us twice a week or he can do his own laundry. He figured out that doing laundry for everybody includes rugs, curtains, bedsheets and etc. is too much. So, he chose doing his own laundry. I changed the schedule again, and he now have more responsibilities. Added to it is the responsibility to keep his room clean. I routinely check every day and tell him off if it is messy. I indoctrinate him to start a productive day by fixing the bed before leaving for school.\\\\n\\\\nAt 14 my son is now independent. He goes to gym at 6am everyday, make his own breakfast, and be in school at 9:00. He do his laundry once a week, he cleaned our staircase, help around in the garden, cook dinner, do dishes on weekends and clean the car. He also starts dating and he kept everything tidy to impress the girls.\\\\n\\\\nMind you, there was a lot of long talks and even nagging when he was 11, but the key is consistency. After 2 years of consistent schedule and expectations, he start taking it as his new normal.\\\\n\\\\nYou see, giving responsibilities to kids start when they are young. We make our son understand that to be happy is not about living life as one pleases, but having responsibilities and meaning. With him having responsibilities, he is happier. Though, I still hear occasional complaints and murmuring that I am the strictest Filipina mom he ever met. \\\\ud83d\\\\ude01\", \"',\n",

Putting them elsewhere may be upsetting, but it is not as bad as irreversibly removing the objects. ) Do the same for a bathroom. (Just one). Other people are welcome to use it, but the only objects that are allowed to live in that bathroom are linens, cleaning products, and soap.\\\\n\\\\nThen you take a look at everything you have in your room and your bathroom, and figure out what you don\\\\u2019t need and get rid of it. If you need to, lay out the items you plan to get rid of and let the rest of the family have the opportunity to keep anything they want. Donate what you can, and trash the rest.\\\\n\\\\nNext, get some clorox wipes and wipe down everything. Use Windex/paper towels to wash windows, mirrors, and other glass. Find a tile soap (I like Kaboom but anything that says its for showers/tile will work) and scrub your bathroom within an inch of its life (spray cleaner on tiled surfaces\\\\u2014make sure you have some kind of ventilation like the fan running or a window open\\\\u2014let it soak for about five minutes, then use a brush or sponge to wash away the soap. When you do the floors, having a rinse bucket is handy. And if every thing is coming away black, you may need to do this more than once to really get everything clean). If you have hard water build up, you can use pumice stone to remove it from porcelain and tiles with a bit of effort. Or you can try CLR. Make sure you get toilet bowl cleaner and a brush (squirt the cleaner in a circle along the inside of the bowl above the water line. Let it sit for a few minutes and then scrub with the brush, flush, and repeat as needed) Wipe down everything in your bedroom too. You might want to get a few magic erasers to do the walls too, depending on how dirty they are. Don\\\\u2019t forget to vacuum everything (including vents!).\\\\n\\\\nIf you have some spending money, go to target/walmart/amazon and get some storage bins, hangers, and other organizational items (there are tons of videos on organizing on youtube). Try and sort your stuff into categories\\\\u2014T-shirts, shorts, jeans, dress clothes, socks, under wear, etc\\\\u2014 so you know what you\\\\u2019ll need to keep it organized. Get a plastic bin/basket for under your bathroom sink/in the closet to keep all your cleaning supplies organized. Use shelf liner/contact paper to line the bottom of any cabinets and drawers (easy to wipe clean, easy to replace if something spills and makes a huge mess).\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have everything put away, label everything. it is easier to put things where they belong if it is clear where they belong.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, make sure you have a system in place for laundry (ie a few laundry baskets/bags to keep everything in between washes), and set yourself a routine. For example, I like to tidy up my apartment from the mess of the week on saturday mornings, and then do more serious cleaning and prep food for the week on sundays. Depending on how much traffic the bathroom gets, you can wash it every week/every other week and do little wipe downs of surfaces as messes happen.\", \"',\n",

Or, she just got tired of waiting around for you to clean your room and did it herself. You need to call a parent child conference and talk, not argue, this through and come to some agreements. Then you need to stick to those agreements without excuses. Try picking up after yourself immediately, on a daily basis, or, even better, put things where they belong in the first place. That makes cleaning easier. Cleaning chores happen first thing in the morning and last thing at night.. if you do them regularly and put things in their proper places when finished using them it only takes a few minutes.. Do the simplest cleaning chores every day, dusting and vacuuming is done once or twice a week. Make it part of your regular schedule. Dirty clothes go in the laundry bin or basket, not wherever you drop them. You might consider actually learning how to use the washer and dryer.. ask your mom to show you. Then do laundry whenever you have a load. While you are at it you might ask her to teach you how to use the dishwasher.

I was only responsible for \\\\\"Ann\\\\\" and her bedroom and bathroom. She shared these rooms with her mother so I always made both beds and cleaned the whole bathroom. I did anything I could to help Ann\\'s sister. I did laundry, cleaned and swept the great room and dining room. These people treated me like family so it felt right to help everyone out. I had another lady that lived with her husband and adult son. This lady lived in a nice home and as far as I could tell it was clean. Little did I know she was very specific about how things were done. I had to dust everyday, change bed sheets every other day, clean the wooden blinds slat by slat in every room twice a week. Vacuum the mattress weekly as well as the couch. I had to dust the dining table, chairs and hutch twice a week along with the knick knacks. And wash the windows every other day; but she never let me clean the kitchen. I worked for a grouchy old paraplegic man. I had to do laundry, cook meals, do dishes, and keep the bathroom clean. Then there was one of my favorite consumers, 28 year old quadraplegic heroin addict with the sweetest dog ever. I was more like a maid; his friends would dirty up the dishes and kitchen. I got to clean it. The bathroom I kept thoroughly sanitized for reasons I don\\'t think I need to disclose and I would keep the carpets clean and dust because I couldn\\'t stand it.

It had been years since his wheelchair fit into the kitchen. When sue seen the pure joy on her baby boys face she let me clean and organize other rooms in the house.

       "   2: ': \"What causes polished concrete floors to crack? The question goes on to describe a contractor\\\\u2019s reluctance to install a polished concrete floor because of an adjacent railway corridor and the possibility that it would cause the concrete to crack.\\\\n\\\\nConcrete is very strong in compressive metrics. You can put tens of thousands of pounds on a slab, and if the material underneath it doesn\\\\u2019t budge, the concrete will support the load without complaint. This means creating a subgrade material that meets the structural load requirements, and compensating for the lateral and directional dynamics (or forces) that would push the concrete apart. This is where tie beams, reinforcing steel, welded wire fabric, or other reinforcing materials come to play. Reinforce a slab sufficiently, cure it correctly, and use appropriate control joint/expansion joints, and concrete shouldn\\\\u2019t crack. This is known as structurally engineering the concrete correctly.\\\\n\\\\nStructurally engineering concrete correctly anticipates known forces/stresses that will be imposed on the concrete, both during curing, and afterwards. If you place and finish a concrete slab near a source of abnormal forces, especially ground shaking or vibration caused by heavy traffic, railway vehicles, or seismic or other influences, all bets are off. Suppose a heavy train speeds by during the set but not cured interval of the concrete slab. The slab is shaken or vibrated by the forces transmitted through the soil and subgrade into the concrete, and these forces work against the concrete causing it to crack. Providing the slab has sufficient reinforcing bars/mesh to hold it together, and the vibrations didn\\\\u2019t cause the subgrade to shift, ordinary flooring would camouflage the damage and it wouldn\\\\u2019t be a problem. Now, if you have a polished concrete floor where nothing can hide the crack(s), there is a serious issue. Polished concrete is incredibly hard to repair, whether the damage is spalling during construction, or expansion cracks. I wouldn\\\\u2019t want to place myself in the position of judging your contractor\\\\u2019s motive for preferring not to install the polished concrete floor, but I do sympathize with them.\", \"',\n",

       "   5: ': \"When making concrete it\\'s important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix.\\\\n\\\\nTo make concrete there are four basic materials you need: portland cement, sand, aggregate (stone), and water. The ratio of aggregate to sand to cement is an important factor in determining the compressive strength of the concrete mixture.\\\\n\\\\nA concrete mixture ratio of 1 part cement, 3 parts sand, and 3 parts aggregate will produce a concrete mix of approximately 3000 psi.\\\\n\\\\nMixing water with the cement, sand, and stone will form a paste that will bind the materials together until the mix hardens. The strength properties of the concrete are inversely proportional to the water/cement ratio.\\\\n\\\\nBasically this means the more water you use to mix the concrete (very fluid) the weaker the concrete mix. The less water you use to mix the concrete (somewhat dry but workable) the stronger the concrete mix.\\\\n\\\\nAccurate concrete mixing ratios can be achieved by measuring the dry materials using buckets or some other kind of measuring device.

Likewise, one typically needs to hit the nail quite hard. It is best to grip the nail with a pair of pliers to save the fingers being pulped. Or, even better, drive the nail through a piece of timber and on into the concrete.

He doesn\\'t give a flying fig about you, me, the Constitution, what\\'s best for the country, the fate of the thousands of his followers he encouraged to go catch COVID-19. It\\'s only and ever about Trump. If you don\\'t understand this, you can\\'t understand Trump. If you hear this and don\\'t believe it, I suggest you\\'re one of the many he\\'s conned or grifted in his long career.\\\\n\\\\nThe Power\\\\n\\\\nFor one, Trump loves the power. Prior to the Presidency, Trump ran a family real estate business that morphed into a name licensing business. He was never the business mogul that was portrayed by the Trump character on his game show, \\\\u201cThe Apprentice.\\\\u201d But as a normal President, he would be in the position to set policy and give orders. But in his Presidency, he\\'s run things like the petty dictator or a banana republic, where the only qualification to hold any position in his administration is blind loyalty to Ill Douche.\\\\n\\\\nThe Presidency also brought him his \\\\u201cbase\\\\\" -- his very own throngs of adoring fans. He restarted rallies immediately after winning the Presidency, and launched his 2020 campaign in January of 2017. This is all about boosting his ego, making a man who\\'s never felt good enough about himself feel good for a few hours.\\\\n\\\\nThe Daddy Issues\\\\n\\\\nTrump was raised by a tyrannical father to believe that losing is an unacceptable weakness. Fred Trump built the business and, even after Trump became the figurehead, Fred was still calling the shots until he lost his mind. Donald grabbed the reins, and that pretty much always ended in failure. So he jumped onto naming things, pretending to run real estate projects that just bought the name, bankrupting casinos once his thumbprint was on them. He ran a series of failed scam businesses: Trump Steaks, Trump Air, Trump University, etc\\\\u2026 always some kind of grift. Those made money, initially, because of his one win: he made $400 million over TV and branding due to \\\\u201cThe Apprentice.\\\\u201d And that, along with grifting investors to move his personal stake out of failing businesses like his three Atlantic City casinos enabled him an \\\\u201cout\\\\\" that hid at least some of the need to cope with ultimately having lost at something. And if money is a barometer, is it really a loss if you pocket millions from a scam like Trump University or the Trump Charity Foundation, even if they\\'re ultimately shut down?\\\\n\\\\nBut losing the Presidency, as much as the Donald J. Trump Neverending Whine Festival, Pity Party, and Coup d\\'Etat would like you to question, is fundamentally a black and white thing. Trump lost, and not by small margins. He is having to cope with that, and seems to have the emotional fortitude of a three year old being denied his binky.\\\\n\\\\nThe Crime\\\\n\\\\nTrump has absolutely run the Executive Branch like a Mafia Crime Family, which is no surprise. Because that is exactly how Fred Trump ran the family business, and the only form of management Trump has ever known. He demands that blind loyalty, to him alone, screw the Constitution, screw the People, screw the Law.\\\\n\\\\nOne ultimate expression of this has been his lawless administration. Bill Maher called this the \\\\u201cGussing\\\\\" of the country. \\\\u201cGus\\\\\" is an old Disney film about a field-goal kicking mule. The rules did not specifically state that a goal kicker had to be human. This is Trump\\'s approach to government. He\\'s raking in millions from corporations and foreign governments via his properties, because he\\'s President. Forbidden by the emoluments clause of the Constitution? Very much so, but what are you going to do about it? Congressional subpoenas? Nope\\\\u2026 no doing it, sue me, it\\'ll spend a decade in court. Stealing money from the military to build the wall? It\\'s not illegal if you get away with it. And so on.\\\\n\\\\nSimply put, based on his upbringing and mentoring under his father, always seeking that approval that he never got, he approaches every new thing as a grift. A con. A cheat. That\\'s not his last recourse to save a failing business as we find with so much white collar crime. It\\'s his first thought. Like a mobster. It\\'s long been understood in psychology that people who cheat believe that everyone who\\'s successful also cheats. Trump might actually believe that only cheater win and losers are the ones who either didn\\'t cheat or got outscammed by a better cheater. Which, of course, is the motivation to enter with the cheat and never even bother trying it straight.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, as I had forgotten and John Hagelbarger [ https://www.quora.com/profile/John-Hagelbarger ] pointed out, Trump had Roy Cohn as a mentor. Cohn was a dirty tricks guy for the infamous Senator Joseph McCarthy. It\\\\u2019s pretty clear Trump learned his skills at situational immorality and personal attacks straight out of Cohn\\\\u2019s playbook. Cohn\\\\u2019s main rules of conduct:\\\\n\\\\n * Never settle, never surrender.\\\\n * Counter-attack, counter-sue immediately.\\\\n * No matter what happens, no matter how deeply into the muck you get, claim victory and never admit defeat.\\\\nSound like anyone we know who\\\\u2019s been involved in over 4,500 lawsuits? Cohn went from relative disgrace in Washington to becoming a major power broker, often working for those same mob guys that the Trump\\\\u2019s were dealing with in their Real Estate business. Cohn knew who to bribe, who to extort, etc. to make things happen in New York. He was instrumental in making the Trump business successful where others were not in NYC. He was the dirtiest guy in town.\\\\n\\\\nThe Law\\\\n\\\\nThe thing that bakes people\\'s noodles -- mine as well -- is how open Trump is about the cheating. He gets on National television and basically says outright \\\\u201cI am cheating you\\\\\" and yet people support him. He puts it in small print on his donation forms, but the cheat is still spelled out, but it still fools people. He tells different audiences contradictory things and yet they both fall for it. He lies, he fails, he lies again, fails again, and still they believe the next lie.\\\\n\\\\nI guess that\\'s what makes a Con Artist -- the ability to keep convincing marks. It\\'s just that it\\'s so damn frustrating that to a person grounded in objective reality, he\\'s so bloody transparent I can\\'t imagine my dog falling for it. Even when she was a puppy!\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the exposure of all of this continual corrupt behavior has not gone unnoticed by The Law. It had been\\\\u2026 Trump was always a shady character around New York, maybe even worse in all his cheating in Atlantic City. But it had never quite been visible above the level of Trump\\'s 4500-something civil court cases.\\\\n\\\\nBut Trump\\'s cheating in the election of 2016 sent Michael Cohen to prison, and certainly would have sent Trump there as well had he lost the election. Numerous investigations into Trump\\'s finances showed huge debts, shady deals, money laundering, potential tax fraud, etc\\\\u2026 all pressed forward by the publicity of his Presidency, all stymied by the reluctance or outright policy against prosecuting a sitting President. That\\'s all moving forward when he\\'s out of office. And numerous investigations have continued while he has been in office.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s also well understood that Trump has those huge debts. Some $350 million or more come due in the next two years, and Trump\\'s last know last resort bank, Deutsche Bank, holds much of that debt and will not offer extensions or new loans to the Trumps. And if Trump gets into serious criminal trouble, those loans can be called immediately.\\\\n\\\\nSo this is a big reason he wanted to stay in office. Most potential crimes done by Trump or in conjunction with the Trump Organization face a stature of limitations that would pass in a second Trump term, had he won. Prison and/or the poor house can be a mighty strong motivation for a gold plated dandy like Trump.\\\\n\\\\nThe Money\\\\n\\\\nIn mid-October, Trump started raising money for what would be dubbed as his need to defend election integrity. Just as in 2016, Trump had started claiming, without evidence of course, that he could only lose if his opponent cheated. Understanding Trump\\'s cheat-as-a-first-move mentality, that really meant \\\\u201cif his opponent cheated better than he did.\\\\u201d That also helps serve to cushion the fall of his crystalline ego smashing to the floor of an honest defeat, as is didn\\'t in 2016 but certainly did in 2020.\\\\n\\\\nSo that early money went to a Trump Leadership PAC, to the campaign itself, and a little bit to an actual \\\\u201cRecount Fund\\\\\" meant to fund legal challenges. Pre-election, it\\'s standard practice to employ teams of white-shoe lawyers, set to pounce on any problem that might prove election-changing. There is very little time after the election to plan this, and as the 2000 election demonstrated, things can wind up being decided in court. That only happened once, but yeah, normal these days to prepare. Joe Biden\\'s campaign also had a legal team on tap.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the campaign, the fundraising moved to fight the results. In that first week, the Recount Fund got 40% of the money coming in, while the campaign got 60%, largely to pay off campaign debt. Most owed to the Trump Organization, so immediately into Trump\\'s pocket. But really, the legal team had very little to do. Yes, Trump launched lawsuits all over the place, but with one problem: none of them had the slightest basis in fact. Trump can scam the public from his bully pulpit as President, but his lawyers can\\'t lie to judges and expect to remain lawyers. So in less than two weeks, the white shoe lawyers all quit.\\\\n\\\\nThe end? Nope\\\\u2026 but why? Trump\\'s ego? Well, so next up, Trump brings in Crazy Rudy Giuliani to head up a team of Fox News TV Lawyers. These are not the people even Trump would bring in to mount a serious legal defense. But for the court of public opinion, they\\'re kooky, but better than \\\\u201cno lawyer.\\\\u201d At the same time, all money coming in goes to Trump\\'s Leadership PAC and the RNC in a 75/25 split. They\\'re still raising money to \\\\u201cstop the steal\\\\\" or whatever, but none is actually going toward those efforts, which also aren\\'t much a thing anymore anyway. But the idea of them? That is making bank. How much? About $450 million between mid-October and the last mandatory FEC filing at the beginning of December\\\\u2026 the December haul won\\'t likely be known until next week.\\\\n\\\\nMoney in Trump\\'s leadership PAC can\\'t be used to fund regular campaign expenses for just next campaign, if there is one, but they can pay for just about anything else. Even personal expenses, family vacations, etc. This is a PAC construct used by most people in Congress as little more than a slush fund. The idea of a leadership PAC was to enable party leaders to function in leadership roles: fund campaigns, hire consultants, pay for polling, pay for their \\\\u201cwizened council\\\\u201d to other campaigns. But they have very few restrictions on use. And even if Trump\\'s personal or corporate assets are frozen or seized, they can\\'t touch this.\\\\n\\\\nSo think about it\\\\u2026 it took Trump 13 years of the Apprentice, associated licensing, brand improvements, foreign show versions, etc. to bring in $400 million. His supporters put more than that in his pocket in under two months\\\\u2026 and it\\'s not over yet. Not by far. He\\'s still raising money to fight the election, despite his efforts to cheat the electoral college having fallen completely flat. Now it\\'s on to the official tally of the EC vote in Congress next week. He won\\'t cheat that, either, though he looks to have a few Senators and a bunch of Congresspeople make dubious investments in their political futures by supporting yet another losing effort at coup d\\'etat. And it\\'s unclear why Trump needs to raise, only for this -- is he actually purchasing those Congressfolk? But yet the money come in.\\\\n\\\\nAnd it wouldn\\'t be classic Trump without an additional grift. The initial fundraisers told you to donate and get a 1000% match\\\\u2026 online, you had to beat a ticking clock, because this was a limited offer. What the fine print on the box you probably didn\\'t uncheck, full of paragraphs of ALL CAPS lies about the Democrats, followed by a last little bit that explained that you were the donor for the 1000% match. You signed up for ten matching payments. Next, they added a second opted-in box full of paragraphs of ALL CAPS lies about the Democrats, followed by an extra payment you\\'ll make in early December on top of your other December payment. And the last version I read kept everything the sane except now that 10-payment first box full of ALL CAPS lies about the Democrats now deleted the 10 payment part and just said \\\\u201cmonthly.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSo, in short, Trump\\'s big wet sloppy kiss to his supporters on the way out also included his own special cut-purse move. It will be interesting to see the December and January totals coming in, which might be a good indication of how many supporters fell for these things. I\\'ll give him credit\\\\u2026 the design of the web site, the 500-something fundraising email rounds, etc. were all designed well to snooker just the sort of person who responds to Trump in the first place. I wonder if this is pure Con Artist instinct, standard political operative fare by now, or if the have a cognitive psychologist helping on these things.\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\nHow Donald Trump and Roy Cohn\\\\u2019s Ruthless Symbiosis Changed America [ https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship ]\\\\n\\\\nWere you conned into donating to Donald Trump\\'s election defense fund?

       "   3: ': \"I want to preface this answer with a few statements to try to put things in prospective\\\\n\\\\n1. I am a democrat\\\\n2. I am not in any way shape or form in support of Donald Trump or his policies\\\\nNow that we have that out of the way, I took some time this morning to dig into some of the things Trump has accomplished in the last 4 years. The answers on this topic as expected are HEAVILY tainted with political biases, but that is not necessarily a problem. This is a political question and like those I am sure some of my bias will also penetrate into my answers as well.\\\\n\\\\nSome of these accomplishments may be considered controversial to some, others will decry them as accidents or outcomes of overall negative policies, but I will offer some comments as to my thinking. I am not in anyway ignoring the MANY disastrous and unethical policies pursued by trump, just trying to answer the spirit of the question.\\\\n\\\\nThat said I have tried to consider the impact of some of these policies and determine if they are good or bad, beneficial or detrimental etc. So this is a list of accomplishments of Trump\\\\u2019s that I think were beneficial to the United States or the world. I will reveal the best thing I think Trump has done at the end of this list.\\\\n\\\\n1. Declassification and release of JFK Files- finally we will know if MIB was invovled\\\\n2. Repaired and replaced a great deal of aging border control fences and systems - while trump has made many controversial claims on this program the positive outcome was lots of repair and investment.\\\\n3. Continued Economic Growth following the Great Recession -many will argue that he didn\\'t do anything to make this happen and that in its own way is something. The point is that he didn\\'t really screw it up too bad for a while there.\\\\n4. 1st Female Head of the CIA - seems like small potatoes but this is an import action. During trumps tenure we have seen more and more women in positions of prominence and power.\\\\n5. Establishment of numerous Space Policy initiatives - Space is going to be important for our future both scientifically and economicly.\\\\n6. Establishment of Space Force - Yes I know the name is dumb and the uniforms are just Star Trek copies but I really think we need to be thinking hard about how we are going to move forward in space and how we are going to protect and defend our assets and interests. This is a place to start\\\\n7. Breast Feeding Access in Airports - This is important as we as a society have allowed our religious and moral beliefs to overshadow our innate humanity. Such a law should not be needed in an enlightened society but we need laws like this to help break these ignorant stigmas\\\\n8. Maintained, Increased, or Expanded Military Funding - I know there are two vehemently different opinions on this front. I feel that maintaining our military and supporting our troops are vital to our long term survival as a nation. I may not agree with HOW we use all the funding but I think its a good thing that this was done in general\\\\n9. Donated Salary to the government/Charity - I know all the arguments on this one on how much he has made through entanglements, but I think this is a good thing and though I suspect it was not his intent I think this is something that shows leadership.\\\\n10. North Korea Prisoner Release - Again this is one of those Great outcomes for the wrong reasons type of scenarios. Trump had all the wrong reasons for engaging with North Korea and pretty much botched the whole affair but he was able to gin some key positives from his efforts.\\\\n11. Signed 9/11 victims funding Bill - Yes I know this is pretty weak sauce but I point this out because this is what presidents are supposed to do. They are supposed to support and sign good legislation without constantly trying to make a buck on the deal\\\\n12. Black University Funding - Im still a little confused on how this one came to be, I suspect it was a publicity stunt more than anything but I think that it is a net positive.\\\\n13. Executive Order on Foreign Election Interference - This one is no doubt controversial and is going to be getting a lot of attention here shortly BUT this is what Executive Orders are for and what they should be. This is an order that directs the government to investigate and report Foreign election interference and to take steps to communicate and combat it to help improve future election integrity.\\\\n14. Cyber Security Executive Order - See number 13\\\\n15. First Step Act - I doubt trump had much to do with driving this forward but he did sign it into law and this is the type criminal reform we need to help our nation move forward.\\\\nImprove the Veterans Administration Finally, this is what I think was the best thing trump has accomplished while in office. Numerous policies and laws were enacted in the last four years to increase Accountability at the VA, to expand Telemedicine, reduce drug costs, restore funding and improve overall standard of care. We cannot forsake those who have served to preserve our way of life.\\\\n\\\\nSo what do you think?\", \"',\n",

Joe will then walk into the White House and the Secret Service and Marines stationed at the White House will let him in without question.\\\\n\\\\nJoe Biden will then head for the Oval Office if he so choses.

The Shark IONFlex vs Dyson V8 review will present you a detailed analysis of these two cordless vacuum cleaners. This will definitely help your decision-making process just in case you are confused about which to buy.\\\\n\\\\nFirst of all, shark and Dyson have proven to be makers of top quality vacuum cleaners in the market today. It can be really challenging to settle for one as both are great buys and definitely worth every penny spent on them.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, we\\'ll try to look at specifics of both the Shark IONFlex and the Dyson V8 cordless vacuum cleaners critically and leave you to make a decision based on these analyses.\\\\n\\\\nAbout Shark\\\\n\\\\nShark makes quality corded and cordless vacuum cleaners. Then are also known for their impressive robot vacuum cleaners as well. Shark vacuums are known for their superb performance, manoeuvrability, strong suction power, among others.\\\\n\\\\nAbout Dyson\\\\n\\\\nDyson has proven to be the market leader over time in relation to making quality corded and cord-free vacuum cleaners as well. It\\'s been the number one in customer satisfaction with stick vacuums, 3 years in a row. These vacuums also come with great suction power and are highly intelligent. They pick up the tiniest of dirt. Their durability also is top notch and are quite easy to maintain since they hardly breakdown.\\\\n\\\\nNow, for brevity of my answer, I will only review two points for comparison.\\\\n\\\\nTechnology\\\\n\\\\nRegarding technology, the Shark IONFlex comes with DuoClean technology. This is a combination of a bristle brush and soft roller which gets the cleaning done efficiently. The Shark IONFlex can easily pick up fine dust and small and large particles on any kind of surface.\\\\n\\\\nThe Dyson V8, on the other hand, is powered by the digital motor V8. It\\'s said to be a very powerful motor which gives the vacuum a boost to its suction power. It also offers two heads, the soft roller and the direct drive. While the soft roller removes fine dust from surfaces, the direct drive focuses on larger and stuck dirt on surfaces.\\\\n\\\\nBased on technology, one thing that can\\'t be taken from both vacuums is that they both have a strong suction power and switches between different modes depending on work at hand for better performance.\\\\n\\\\nBattery Performance\\\\n\\\\nBased on battery performance, the Shark IONFlex comes with a removable, rechargeable lithium-ion battery. This powers the device for roughly 15 mins at Max mode on a full charge. However, the Shark IONFlex comes with two batteries at purchase. This gives you about 30 mins of clean time.\\\\n\\\\nThe Dyson V8, however, comes with 1 battery. It offers an average of 20 mins of runtime depending on the mode on which you clean.\\\\n\\\\nSo, based on battery performance, the Shark IONFlex could offer you a little more clean time.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are still interested in comparison with respect to design, price and the best buy options for these vacuum cleaners, you can read the rest of my answer here [ https://newcordlessvacuums.com/shark-ionflex-vs-dyson-v8-which-is-best/ ].\", \"',\n",

You attach a vacuum pump and create a vacuum inside, Now, a perfect vacuum means that no and absolutely no particle should exist inside it. This is not possible because the walls of the container will radiate photons which in turn will create electron-positron pairs inside the box. So, no perfect vacuum for you. What if no protons are radiated? Well that\\'s only possible that the temperature of the box is 0 Kelvin (that\\'s -273 degree centigrade). This temperature cannot be practically achieved at your home. Another thing is that when there is completer vacuum inside the box, the pressure difference inside and outside the box will be so large that the box will be crushed when you touch it (it might be automatically crushed by the atmospheric pressure). So, a perfect vacuum is impossible to create at your home.

You probably view washing your car as a \\\\u201enecessary nuisance\\\\u201c.\\\\n\\\\nSo, looking at it from a perspective of necessities, here is what I can tell you:\\\\n\\\\n * If your car serves representative functions (i.e. for instance, if you use it commercially, or if in public, your business may get associated with your car and the shape it is in), you should wash it as often as is needed to look good. This may, in extreme scenarios, be as often as twice a day (for instance, if you are offering high-class limousine services, there is bad weather, and you have several clients use your services). For a consistent, decent appearance, thouroughly washing your car at least once a week will do though, under normal conditions.\\\\n * If you just want to increase the lifespan of your car by giving it proper care, then you won\\\\u2019t have to wash it every week. But you should also not neglect it for half a year, and then give it \\\\u201epremium treatment\\\\u201c to make up for it. Dust and grime over time build up, and develop acids that can seriously damage your car, and lead to rusty spots, that will be expensive to repair. A good intervall is around once a month, latest point once every two months (all assuming daily use).\\\\n * Frequency above quality: If you wash your car regularly, your paint and metal parts will optimally be protected at all times. That is way better than to neglect it, then get the most expensive program at your car wash once a year. Personally, I normally always choose the cheapest program available - but I make sure to thouroughly take care of certain details no car wash can cover, such as manually wiping out the spaces in between the doors and the chassis with a clean microfiber towel right after the car wash. This is where dirt and grime typically build up - which is ugly, and corrosive.\\\\n * Special case: Bird poo! Bird poo is extremely aggressive! If a bird takes a dump on your car, and then your car sits out in the glaring sun for just one or two days (the temperature increasing the chemical activity), the strong acids in the poo can significantly damage your paint. You will see the damage after wiping it off: There is a dull spot on the paint, that could only get corrected by taking off some of the clear coat by polishing your car (again, expensive). So when you notice bird poo on your car, make sure to remove it as fast as possible. As a quick solution, a microfiber towel with luke warm water, or with window cleaner on it will do.\\\\n\", \"',\n",

In warmer temperatures, washing is only required when the vehicle gets dirty. However if you wash too much it can damage the vehicle in the areas of paint, weather lining (insulation), and glass. So I recommend washing when you have a good amount of visible dirt on your vehicle. Salt is visible even on white vehicles and soil is pretty visible on any color.

       "   5: ': \"Can be taken anywhere\\\\n\\\\nOne of the most significant advantages of a cordless vacuum cleaner is that we can carry it anywhere, at home, in the car, or in the office. It is very convenient, especially for families with child seats installed in the car, which can have a cordless vacuum cleaner. It helped the family solve a big problem.\\\\n\\\\nNo towing power cord\\\\n\\\\nThe cordless vacuum cleaner does not have a towed power cord. It can be cleaned anytime and anywhere, where it is dirty, and it has a strong suction power and a guaranteed cleaning effect.\\\\n\\\\nStrong suction and low energy consumption\\\\n\\\\nThe cordless vacuum cleaner also has a smooth and straight air inlet, which allows air to enter quickly, and the arc-shaped air duct separates it from the dust to achieve the purpose of high-speed dust collection; coupled with an electric floor brush, the motor can actively rotate and clean. It greatly reduces the energy consumption of the vacuum cleaner host and ensures its suction power.\", \"',\n",

It should be lightweight and should have easy to access controls. With these features, you won\\\\u2019t easily feel exhausted when you are cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nCapacity: This refers to how much dirt the container can hold. It should be large enough without being uncomfortable. When the dustbin is big, this means that it will take quite a while before there is a need to have it emptied.\\\\n\\\\nFilter: The filtration capacity of the vacuum cleaner is also important to make sure that it can indeed improve the air quality while getting rid of dirt and dust. It would be best to go for a model that comes with a removable and washable filter, which will be economical in the long run.\\\\n\\\\nPower: You also have to look at the power that the motor can deliver. For most casual users, a small motor will be more than enough. On the other hand, for commercial applications or if you have a large house to clean, you will definitely need a powerful motor that delivers fade-free suction.\\\\n\\\\nVersatility: For the budget-friendly vacuum cleaner to be versatile, it is important that it comes with several attachments and accessories, such as a crevice tool. This will make the product useful in a variety of cleaning applications.\\\\n\\\\nWarranty: This is important because it will provide you with peace of mind. When the vacuum cleaner is still under warranty, the manufacturer will provide free repairs and replacement of defective parts when it experiences a problem, as long as it is not because of your fault.\\\\n\\\\nIf you own pets then go with either the Eureka NEU182A or the Bissell 9595A. Both these vacuums will do a very decent job cleaning fabric upholstery and stairs. Take note that both have cords so you\\\\u2019ll have to constantly plug and unplug.\\\\n\\\\nOur Top Picks For The Best Vacuum Cleaner Under 100\\\\n\\\\nTo make it easier for you to decide, the table below provides a quick summary of the best models, followed by a quick look at the features that make them exceptional products.\\\\n\\\\n1.

Nothing is outsourced. The warranty is excellent, although Miele warranty repairs are exceptionally rare. I use one as a shop vac and one in the home. My ex has my first one, a Callisto manufactured in 1991, and it\\\\u2019s still going strong after 27 years and 3 owners.\\\\n\\\\nOh, and the attachments- they prefer to call them tools.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s one of the better choices you can make for most of your home appliances.

The best choice for you depends on what kinds of cleaning tasks you\\'re taking on:\\\\n\\\\n * Hand vacuums: Affordable, lightweight, and compact, these are great for quickly cleaning small messes or removing pet hair and crumbs from furniture. Of course, they\\'re not great for cleaning entire rooms, and some of them may need to be recharged more often than stick vacuums, but they\\'re convenient and compact.\\\\n * Stick vacuums: Although a bit more expensive, these will be your best bet for cleaning floors with ease, and they have the added bonus of offering quite a bit more cleaning time before needing to be recharged.\\\\n * Convertible vacuums: Although these can be pricier than the first two options, they offer great versatility and can cost less in the long run, since you don\\'t have to invest in multiple appliances. A stick vacuum that converts to a hand vacuum lets you take on both floors and furnitures, but you can also opt for a vacuum with a built-in spray mop for thorough cleaning of hard surfaces.

There were occasions where I would be in the garage cleaning or working on a firearm at my workbench and well if he saw that occurring he did not like it and multiple times called the police, the first couple times were fun, multiple cars with lights on flying up to the end of the driveway. The next couple times the police were considerably less in a rush to respond\\\\u2026 because I was doing nothing wrong at all.\\\\n\\\\nEventually after the 4th or 5th time this happened (took about a year for that) I was talking to the responding officer, who happened to be a Sergent. Both he and I were getting frustrated by the waste of time and resources. After that discussion the Sergent went over to the neighbors and informed him (for the 4th or 5th time) that I was not doing anything illegal and the police could not actually stop me from cleaning a gun on my own property. He went a bit further this time however and informed him that he was clearly noting in the police report that he had informed the neighbor that what I was doing was legal and that continuing to call the police regarding the same thing could result in him being charged with filing false police reports. Not in his report he also informed the guy that I was not overly happy for the hassle and had \\\\u201cmentioned\\\\u201d suing him for harassment. He made it very clear to him that there were now many police reports of him calling the police and having been informed I was doing nothing wrong, which is a lot of evidence that he was using the police to harass me.\\\\n\\\\nThat was the last time I had an issue, I think the reality of fun and games turning into criminal charges and a lawsuit must have sunk in and the neighbor just hand to deal with it.\", \"',\n",

Although a certain amount of fading over time is inevitable, laundering your colors correctly can minimize color loss. Not only is it important to wash with the right detergent in the right temperature water, it matters how you dry. A little extra care will keep your colored clothing brighter longer.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 1\\\\n\\\\nWash colored clothing less often to slow fading. Do this by wearing clothes more than once unless they\\'re really dirty. If you only wear them for a couple of hours and they still smell fresh, hang them back up to wear again.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 2\\\\n\\\\nSeparate your colored clothes from your whites before doing laundry. White clothing, such as T-shirts, socks and underwear, often needs to be washed in hot water, which can accelerate fading.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 3\\\\n\\\\nTurn non-white garments inside out before you wash them, because friction between clothes can dull colored fibers. Inside-out washing prevents the fronts of the garments from rubbing together.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 4\\\\n\\\\nAlways wash colors in cold water. Hand-wash your clothes, if possible. In a machine, wash them on the delicate cycle and set the water temperature to cold.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 5\\\\n\\\\nUse color-protecting laundry detergent and one tablespoon of regular table salt in the wash. Salt helps set the dye in the fabric. Read the package directions to see how much detergent to add.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 6\\\\n\\\\nAdd your clothing to a top-loading washer after it fills with water. Run the washer for the shortest amount of time the settings allow. The less time the clothing has to experience friction, the less fading occurs.\\\\n\\\\nSTEP 7\\\\n\\\\nMinimize how much time clothes are in the dryer, or dry clothing on hangers out of direct sunlight. Create an indoor clothesline by placing clothes on hangers and hanging them on a shower rod. If you use an outdoor clothesline, take the clothes off the line as soon as they\\'re dry, because bright sunlight causes fading.\", \"',\n",

Basically, with this technique you get stain remover or a solvent (such as dry cleaning solvent, and place a small amount onto a sponge or clean cloth and dab that onto the stain.\\\\n\\\\nThis technique is similar to blotting, but generally involves using a bit more liquid on the absorbent cloth you\\'re dabbing with.\\\\n\\\\n8. Pre-soak The Stain For An Hour To Overnight\\\\n\\\\nThe next of these stain removal techniques, and my favorite as a busy Mom, is pre-soaking. With this technique you just dump water plus some stain remover, bleach, pre-soaker, detergent, or whatever else you\\'ve determined will work best to clean the item, into a large tub, or a sink basin, place the clothes in with it, and let it sit there and work on removing the stain while you walk away and do other things.\\\\n\\\\nThe longer it soaks the better it works, in general. However, a word of caution with this technique is that too long a soak, especially in things like chlorine bleach, can damage the fabric or make it fade, so you have to be careful when pre-soaking.\\\\n\\\\nYou can learn more about pre-soaking laundry stains here [ https://www.stain-removal-101.com/presoaking.html ].\\\\n\\\\n9. Pretreat The Stain With A Stain Remover\\\\n\\\\nThe last of the stain removal techniques I\\'ve listed is also one of the most popular, although it doesn\\'t always work as well as some people want. It is pre-treating a stain with a laundry stain remover before washing.\\\\n\\\\nHow effective this technique is depends on the type of laundry stain remover used, the stain it is on, how old the stain is, and how well you spot all the stains and pre-treat them before throwing them in the wash.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea with this technique is simple though. You find the spots and stains, spray or rub a stain remover on then, and then wash like you normally would in the hopes that this extra step will be enough to remove the stain, along with regular washing.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\'re looking for an effective pre-treater I\\'d suggest reading the laundry stain removers reviews I\\'ve got on the site, from readers like you, sharing which products worked best for them on which types of stains.\\\\nFor more information about removing clothing stains, simply follow the link I\\\\u2019ve included above!\", \"',\n",
       "   6: ': \"I have two \\'stand-by\\' products for greasy stains\\\\u2026both fresh and \\'set\\'.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use either one, separately or together. Dawn dishwashing liquid or Murphy\\'s Oil Soap. Murphy\\'s is specifically made for cutting through tough oil and grease. Dawn is too, but it\\'s much more sudsy\\\\u2026meaning you can treat the stain directly, as well you should, with the Murphy\\'s Oil Soap and then you can also add some to the laundry water, unlike Dawn dishwashing liquid, which will create far too many suds in the washing machine should you pour some in with the clothes.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to boost the cleaning ability of either one of them, you can combine them with some baking soda. If you are trying to get grease out of a white piece of clothing, you can blend either the Murphy\\'s or the Dawn with some hydrogen peroxide for the best results. If you use the peroxide combination on colored clothing, it could remove a bit of the color so I wouldn\\'t risk that.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on what type of fabric you are trying to clean, I would not use a brush to scrub with. Oftentimes using a brush raises the nap on the fabric permanently and it will leave evidence of a problem on the fabric forever. Pour a little of the product directly onto the stain and gently rub it in and let it sit for a few minutes before laundering.\\\\n\\\\nThe nice thing about using either Dawn dishwashing liquid or Murphy\\'s Oil Soap is that you can use them as many times as you need if the stain proves to be a bit tougher than you first expected. I have used Murphy\\'s with great success on ancient ground-in axle grease stains and also on relatively new stains. Most of them disappeared on the first wash.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, for best results use the hottest water the fabric can tolerate. If when you remove the item from the washer you can still see the stain, do not send it through the dryer, send it back through the washer again while it is still damp from the first wash. Repeat this process until you get results. But in my experience it usually only takes once.\\\\n\\\\nGood luck to you.\", \"',\n",

I don\\\\u2019t use one of those contraptions with rotating brushes and a solvent reservoir. I use a stiff nylon brush and White Lightning chain lube. If you have a workstand, put the bike in that, or lean it against a wall in such a way that you can freely rotate the cranks backwards. Shift the front derailleur (if you have one) to the middle ring, the rear derailleur to the centermost cog, and dribble the chain lube onto the chain at the center of the cog.

The brushes are weak, the cleaning sponges at the ends get filthy fast, and the cleaning solvent is quickly contaminated.  All in all, it\\'s a really silly way to do things.\\\\n\\\\nDaily bike maintenance can be summed up in one step: hose it down after every ride, but don\\'t force water into the bearings or moving parts.  Just spray enough water to keep the dirt off.\\\\n\\\\nOnce a week (like every Saturday), you get some chain lubricant like Boeshield T9, then work it into all the chain\\'s pins and rollers.  Pedal backwards while wiping off the excess lube and some of the leftover grime that\\'s going to be dripping out.  Let it dry.\\\\n\\\\nDetailed chain cleaning can be done in three easy steps: get some old rags, some citrus degreaser, and a pair of latex gloves.  Suspend the bike on something: a repair stand, a tree branch, a bungee cord off a rafter in your garage, whatever: the firmer, the better.  Douse the first rag in citrus cleaner, then grasp the chain on the bottom and simply pedal backwards.  Also wipe through the cogs in the back of your bike and the chainwheels in the front: it doesn\\'t do you any good to clean your chain simply to have your drivetrain dirty it up all over again.  Work through new sections of the cloth until you\\'re not getting a whole lot of dirt, rinse off the chain and drivetrain with some water while pedaling, then let it dry (use another rage to speed up the process if you want).  Next, lube up the chain like you do every week, and that\\'s it.  That\\'s a simple routine chain cleaning, and it costs less than $20 and takes maybe ten minutes, only needs to be done once a month at most.\\\\n\\\\nSo why do you want to clean your chain as much as possible?  Because the condition of your chain and drivetrain determine how long it\\'ll stay in working condition.  Chains don\\'t grasp onto cogs and chainwheels as firmly when dirty as they would while clean, and a failure on any of those parts could quickly affect the others - a filthy chain could gunk up a chainwheel, which would then seem into the bottom bracket, which means that your ride won\\'t be as smooth, for example.  Or a dirty chain could muck up the jockey and pulley wheels on your rear derailleur, forcing it to eventually pop from the rear sprockets, smacking up your rear derailleur - or worse, your spokes.\\\\n\\\\nAn unlubed chain is almost as bad: the pins and rollers wear out much faster, resulting in chain stretch in less time.

In some cases, you can permanently damage your pool.\\\\n\\\\nYes, it will take time away from your summer fun, but there is nothing that ruins time off like a pool that looks gross or summer money that has to be spent on unnecessary replacement of parts.\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is that there are simple cleaning tasks that need to be done daily, twice weekly, weekly, monthly and seasonally.\\\\n\\\\nMaking sure you do all of these things regularly and with the right tools and supplies will keep your pool looking great, and minimize unforeseen maintenance problems.\\\\n\\\\nHere are the cleaning and maintenance tasks that your pool needs to look great and remain safe.\\\\n\\\\nDAILY POOL CLEANING TASKS\\\\n\\\\nEvery day: check your pool. If you travel for a living, then place a webcam inside your window pointing out to your pool.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a good safety measure anyway, since things can go wrong and you want to catch problems quickly.\\\\n\\\\nFrom a cleaning standpoint, even little bits of dirt and debris can quickly turn your pool into a big mess.\\\\n\\\\nEvery day you should skim your pool with a net (or if you aren\\\\u2019t around, a robotic pool skimmer) to collect leaves, bugs, anything floating in your pool. You want to do this daily to prevent those items from water logging and sinking to the bottom of your pool, where they can do harm.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, floaters will eventually clog your pool filter and cause your pool pump to not work as efficiently, which further degrades the quality of your pool water and wasted electricity.\\\\n\\\\nTWICE PER WEEK\\\\n\\\\nKeeping your pool\\\\u2019s chemistry just right plays a huge role in keeping your pool clean and healthy.\\\\n\\\\nCheck the three most important chemical levels in your pool \\\\u2013 pH, salt (if a salt water system) and free chlorine \\\\u2013 twice a week.\\\\n\\\\nTIP: Use a wifi-connected floating chem test unit to keep on top of this if you aren\\\\u2019t at home during the week.\\\\n\\\\nIf you find that your water quality is off, adjust it by adding the right chemicals in the right amounts, as follows:\\\\n\\\\n * to lower your pH/make it more acidic, add muriatic acid\\\\n * to increase your pH/make it more alkaline, add baking soda\\\\n * to increase chlorine, add liquid chlorine or add dry shock to your pool\\\\nKeeping these basic water quality parameters in check will help keep algae in check as well.\\\\n\\\\nWhile you\\\\u2019re testing your pool it\\\\u2019s a good time to skim debris from the surface and clean your filter skimmer baskets.\\\\n\\\\nif you want to now more information,you can visit at following site:\\\\n\\\\nhttps://thepoolinsider.com/\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \"Interesting question.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, no. Detergents work to help loosen soil from dishes, and even more importantly, they hold the soil in \\\\u201csuspension\\\\u201d and prevent the re-deposition of dirt back on your dishes.\\\\n\\\\nWater only, will clean dishes to a degree. But you would be dissatisfied as you would most likely have some filming on your dishes and some would likely have gritty residue deposits. Your dishwasher tub and door will have a film on it as well. (I can vouch from experience, as I have tried washing with no detergent.)\\\\n\\\\nThe grease and dirt that come off the dishes is recirculating in the water being pumped/sprayed over the dishes. Not using detergent would be akin to what it would be like putting a clean plate into a sink of greasy/dirty hot water. Your plate would come out with a thin film of grease on it.\\\\n\\\\nYes, hot water will melt grease, but grease is attracted to objects. If you would put detergent into the sink of hot water, enough to hold the grease and dirt in suspension, your clean plate when put into the water, would come out still clean (just a little sudsy.) In other words the detergent keeps the grease from attaching itself to objects by holding it \\\\u201caway\\\\u201d from the dishes.\\\\n\\\\nAt the molecular level, the grease would rather attach itself to the molecules of the detergent than to attach itself to your dishes. A similar process occurs with the other forms of soil in your dishwater/dishwasher. The detergent prevents them from reattaching themselves to your dishware. That is, they prevent re-deposition.\\\\n\\\\nBeing and appliance collector and tester, I can\\\\u2019t overestimate the value of a good detergent. It will give you cleaner and shinier dishes and it will protect your dishwasher as well, by helping to prevent deposition on the tub and the internal components. If you have hard water, it is vital to use a premium detergent and a rinse aid for cleanliness and to protect your machine form hard water (calcium carbonate) deposition. (Also if you are using a machine marketed in the U.S. make sure your hot water is at least 120 degrees F, entering the machine.)\\\\n\\\\nPenny-wise is pound foolish, and buying a cheap detergent will cause problems in the long run. You can read Consumer Reports Magazine, or Consumer Reports Online and see the ratings of the various detergents.\\\\n\\\\nAs a general rule, the top rated ones tend to be the tablets and pods. The boxed powders fall in the middle of the ratings. the liquid and \\\\u201cgel\\\\u201d detergents tested dead last, even the name brands. Also the \\\\u201cecology\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cgreen\\\\u201d detergents did not fair to well, but were in the lower middle of the ratings.\\\\n\\\\nFrom my personal experience of dishwasher testing, I have found my favorites to be Cascade \\\\u201cPlatinum 16X\\\\u201d, and Finish \\\\u201cMax-In-One Powerball.\\\\u201d Both are sterling performers and tend to work well in a variety of water chemistries.\\\\n\\\\nI have not found too much difference between rinse agents such as \\\\u201cJet Dry\\\\u201d and Cascade. But if you have very hard water you might experiment with the various brands and see what works best for you. There is no substitute for having a water softener if you have hard water, as nothing will make your dishes shine and sparkle like soft water. However, using a rinse agent will help, to a degree, to prevent calcium deposits and spotting of dishes and glassware.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"There is no one \\\\u201cyes\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cno\\\\u201d answer for everyone. It depends on your particular conditions.\\\\n\\\\nThe primary use for a rinse agent is to prevent or reduce water spots from remaining on your dishes. If your water hardness (calcium carbonate) is more than about 10 grains per gallon, you will may benefit by a rinse agent.\\\\n\\\\nWater hardness can actually leave deposits of calcite (some refer to this as lime) in your machine, on your racks and on your dishware. A rinse agent will not remove water hardness, but reduces the surface tension of the water, allowing the water to sheet off dishes, rather that form droplets. As these droplets contain calcium, they often will leave spots on your dishware and flatware when they evaporate. Hardness deposits are especially noticeable on glassware.\\\\n\\\\nIf you do not have a central water softener and your dishware shows water spots, you may find a rinse agent will help. It also may help your dishes to shine a little more in hard water conditions.\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a water softener, it takes your water hardness down to zero grains per gallon, so there is no calcium in the water to remain on your dishes. Therefore, a rinse agent is not needed. However, some brands help to prevent \\\\u201cetching\\\\u201d of glassware (a permanent cloudiness in glassware). If you find your glasses getting etched, this is also a good reason to use a rinse agent. Be sure to read the label, some brands claim to prevent or reduce etching and others do not.\\\\n\\\\nMany modern dishwashers have an adjustable rinse aid dispenser. The dispenser puts a few drops of the rinse agent into the final rinse. You can adjust the control for the amount in dispenses, less for soft water and more for hard water. A little tweaking of the control will let you find the level of rinse agent that words best for you.\\\\n\\\\nSo the bottom line of your question, \\\\u201cShould I use a rinse agent in the dishwasher ?\\\\u201d is: let your dishes tell you.\", \"',\n",
       "   4: ': \"Good question, and a common belief.\\\\n\\\\nI have worked with dishwashers for 25 years now, training technicians on them, selling them and advising on them.\\\\n\\\\nMy answer is that it depends on the machine, the environment, the wash load and the program.\\\\n\\\\nOn most basic machines nowadays there is no real drying system, the dishes dry using residual heat from the hot final rinse. Rise agent helps this process.\\\\n\\\\nIf you open the door at the end of the cycle a large amount of hot humid air is released so it does help the drying process.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, in a very cool environment many items cool fast as well so sometimes water droplets remain on them.\\\\n\\\\nOn our top of the range units additional drying features are used that take the moisture away without cooling the inside of the machine too much. On these the process is messed up if there is a sudden ingress of cold air so on these leaving the door closed is better.\\\\n\\\\nMy take is that as a general rule opening the door for 10 seconds at the end of a cycle if you are about is beneficial but is not strictly necessary. Things that really make a difference are the addition of rinse agent and a program with a proper hot rinse rather than the quick or eco wash. Also note that even if you use all in one tablets you can still use rinse agent to complement the drying by filling the dispenser and setting a low dosage level.\\\\n\\\\nSome machines like Asko, Bosch, Siemens and Neff also feature a user settable \\\\u201cExtra dry\\\\u201d setting which can be implemented by going into the \\\\u201cSet up\\\\u201d feature shown in the instruction book.

       "   6: ': \"Q. Is it cost effective to run a dishwasher?\\\\n\\\\nA2A. \\\\u201cCost effectiveness\\\\u201d has two factors associated with it.\\\\n\\\\n1. The actual cost of operating the machine - cost of the appliance, loss of interest on sunken cost, installation cost, operating costs such as electricity used, water used, special detergent, salts, etc.\\\\n2. The cost of time spent on hand washing.\\\\nThere is a third factor called \\\\u201cconvenience\\\\u201d that is not associated with the cost but is a direct benefit. Shall come to this later.\\\\n\\\\nWhen coming to the first part, definitely hand washing is cheaper. Way-way cheaper. But when it comes to second part, then dishwasher is a huge saver, especially for a large family or after a party, etc.\\\\n\\\\nNow about convenience \\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nOur time is at a premium and labour is expensive. Nowadays both adults are working, office work invariably spills over to your home time, the children have their own demands, there are many other chores to be done, and finally you need some time to relax, enjoy TV, talk, spend quality family time, etc. The dishwasher is a boon. No one can seriously doubt the usefulness - cost be damned.\\\\n\\\\nNote that for the dishwasher to be effective and that it should not break down often, it is essential that all dishes and utensils have no large food particles, are rinsed properly before staking them up in the washer. This does take up some time. No one in the right frame of mind would use a dishwasher to wash just a couple of dishes, a sauce pan, some cutlery and limited assorted items. The dishwasher is not going to save you money or time.\\\\n\\\\nIn India and other South Asian countries, maids are available at cheap rates. But these maids are not only not reliable, they don\\\\u2019t do the job properly. They are AWOL when you want them the most. For instance, when they know that you have had an overnight party, they will invariable make themselves scarce or turn up so late that by that time, you have done the washing job by yourself in frustration.\", \"',\n",
       "   7: ': \"Most often spotting of dishware is due to calcium carbonate (calcite) in the water. Most people call it water \\\\u201chardness.\\\\u201d When the water dries off your dishes, some of calcium stays behind as spots. The calcium may also affect cleaning performance as it reacts with your dishwasher detergent and binds it chemically so it can\\\\u2019t do its full job.\\\\n\\\\nIf your water is \\\\u201chard\\\\u201d (above about 10 grains per gallon) then there are several options for you.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want the permanent cure, then I would recommend a whole house water softener. It removes all calcium from your water and give you water of zero hardness. Your dishwasher detergent will work better, and the machine will rinse your dishes more thoroughly. Water sheets off without leaving any residue.\\\\n\\\\nYou will be greatly surprised at the shine factor of your dishes and especially glassware, when you have a water softener. they will literally sparkle.\\\\n\\\\nIf it is not feasible to have a softener, then the next best thing is to use a \\\\u201crinse agent\\\\u201d such as \\\\u201cJet Dry.\\\\u201d Odds are your machine has a reservoir for a rinse agent. The cap is usually on the inside of the door. Just unscrew it and fill it up. Under the screw cap, there may be an adjustment, to control how much is injected into the final rinse water. Usually its\\\\u2019s numbered one to five. If your water is soft, you can get by on number one. For very hard water, then use number 5. Just experiment to see what setting gives you the best results.\\\\n\\\\nAlso make sure the water entering the dishwasher is no cooler than 120 degrees F. Many people make the mistake of setting their hot water tank to 120 and by the time the water gets through the plumbing to the dishwasher, it averages eight to ten degrees of heat loss. Your dishwasher cannot compensate for water below 120 degrees. Also flush your water line by turning on the kitchen faucet and let it run for a moment or two until the water gets hot. Purging out the cold water from the line helps your dishwasher get off to a good start.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, don\\\\u2019t buy a cheap detergent. You get what you pay for. If you look in Consumer Reports magazine or their online website you can find their product tests/ratings of dishwasher detergents.\\\\n\\\\nAs a generalization, the best detergents are the tablets and pods.\\\\n\\\\nIn the middle rankings were the boxed powders.\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all of the worst performers, were the bottled gels. Even the brand names were bad. The \\\\u201cecology\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cgreen\\\\u201d detergents generally did not do well either and were of fair to middling in performance.\\\\n\\\\nAs an appliance collector and tester, I can tell you what I personally have found to be the best detergents. Finish, Max-in-One Powerball tablets and Cascade Platinum 16X are both sterling performers and work well in a variety of water chemistries.\\\\n\\\\nSo to bottom line everything: if spots are getting to you then a water softener will end the battle of spots.\\\\n\\\\nIf this isn\\\\u2019t possible, then a.) use a rinse agent, b.) make sure you use the best detergent you can, because the hard water is going to negate some of its cleaning performance.\\\\n\\\\nNo matter whether you have a softener or not, your dishwasher will not give good performance if the water is not hot enough. Use a thermometer and measure the temp. coming out of the faucet closest to your dishwasher. It has to be 120 minimum and preferably higher. I keep mine about 134 degrees F. The clothes washer and the dishwasher both do a markedly better job when they have proper water temperatures.\", \"',\n",

I thought that was a good idea so I bought both pH test strips and chlorine PPM test strips.\\\\n\\\\nThe booklet does not discuss this, but I have read that it is a good idea to add vinegar to the water as well as salt, because there are multiple possible reactions when you electrolyze the saline solution, and you want the hypochlorous acid solution and not sodium hypochlorite. And in fact there is one brand of home hypochlorous acid generator that sells small plastic capsules containing a pre-measured mixture of vinegar and salt. (Their web site claims the FDA requires them to sell the pre-measured capsules to make sure the end user gets the recipe correct.)\\\\n\\\\nI searched the Internet for a set of guidelines for the home user, and found a discussion on another site that urged adding a *base* rather than an acid to the salt solution before electrolysis. I\\'ve only seen that one place; the suggestion to add vinegar seems to be the common advice.\\\\n\\\\nThe booklet says the reaction is:\\\\n\\\\nNaCl + H20 -%3E NaClO + H2^\\\\n\\\\nWhile the booklet doesn\\\\u2019t discuss the hardware, the Gosoit web site makes these claims about the device: \\\\u201c\\\\u2026with latest Platinum coated Titanium (SPE) electrolysis Plates and the long lifetime Proton Membrane (PEM) made by DuPont in the USA.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ve seen videos of devices like this in operation and bubbles appear in the water; presumably that\\'s the H2.

I\\'m planning to use this in a well-ventilated area.\\\\n\\\\nWe have a large supply of powdered citric acid, so if adding acid is a good idea I would like to work out a recipe that uses citric acid and salt instead of vinegar and salt. According to a video I found, ideally the salt solution should have a pH of \\\\\"between 4 and 5\\\\\". (I measured my tap water and I\\\\u2019d say it\\\\u2019s between 7 and 8.) So presumably I can just start mixing citric acid powder with my tap water, and using my pH test strips, until I find the correct amount of citric acid powder to get a 4.5 pH solution. But I thought I should ask here first before I try it.\\\\n\\\\nAnd I would like to know what I should expect to see on the test strips if the reaction was the desired one. What should I expect the final pH to be? Presumably the PPM test just shows PPM directly and should match what I\\'m trying to make by setting the timer.\\\\n\\\\nI\\'d like a recipe to make 1 litre at a time.

       "   2: ': \"I am going to make some assumptions first.\\\\n\\\\nI am assuming that you have both an AC and a heating unit controlled by the same thermostat. I am assuming you have either a heat pump, or an AC with a gas/electric furnace.\\\\n\\\\nThe answer is no, leaving the thermostat in auto won\\\\u2019t damage the unit, as long as your thermostat is properly setup. Your thermostat should be setup for at least a 2\\\\u00b0 differential between heating and cooling, but a 3\\\\u00b0-4\\\\u00b0 differential is better.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s use a 3\\\\u00b0 differential as this is what is usually programmed into the thermostat. This means that if you set your heating to 68\\\\u00b0, the cooling will be at 71\\\\u00b0. If you raise your heating to 70\\\\u00b0, the minimum cooling setting can be no lower than 73\\\\u00b0. If you go to change cooling to 70\\\\u00b0, your heating temperature will drop to 67\\\\u00b0. This is intentionally built into the programming of the thermostat.\\\\n\\\\nHidden away in the programming, your thermostat may have a 1\\\\u00b0-3\\\\u00b0 offset. When you set heat for 68\\\\u00b0, the thermostat may get down to between 67\\\\u00b0 and 65\\\\u00b0 before turning on the heat. It will heat to 68\\\\u00b0 and stop. The reason there is a differential is due to temperature lag or swing. The unit may shut off at 68\\\\u00b0, but residual heat from the indoor coil (heat pump), heat exchanger (gas furnace), or heating elements (electric furnace), may bring (swing) the temperature up to 69\\\\u00b0, possibly even 70\\\\u00b0. If you have a 3\\\\u00b0 differential, this prevents the AC from coming on at 70\\\\u00b0, and the temp has to raise to 71\\\\u00b0 before it comes on. Basically it\\\\u2019s preventing the heat from raising the temp in the home up to the cooling set point, turning the cooling on, which then gets down to the heating set point, which then turns the heating on, heating to the cooling set point, and so on. The differential prevents a vicious temperature swing cycle and prevents both cooling and heating from turning on simultaneously.\\\\n\\\\nIf your thermostat is programmed correctly, in auto, there will be this 3\\\\u00b0+ differential to prevent that from happening. Since it\\\\u2019s cold outside, the temperature of the home should reach the set point of 68\\\\u00b0, maybe 69\\\\u00b0, and possibly (but very doubtfully) 70\\\\u00b0. At that point, heat starts to escape the house immediately (never actually stops), cooling the house down while the unit is off. The cooling should then never come on.\\\\n\\\\nOutside of turning it on yourself, there is one instance when cooling comes on during the winter, but it has nothing to do with the thermostat. If you have a heat pump, the outside coil has to defrost.\\\\n\\\\nBasically what a heat pump does in heating mode is lower the temperature of the refrigerant going through the outside coil about 20\\\\u00b0 lower than the outside temperature. The allows refrigerant to absorb heat from the air even though it\\\\u2019s cold outside. It brings that heat inside and expels it out of the indoor coil into your home. But if the temperature outside is 50\\\\u00b0, then the temperature of the coil outside is 30\\\\u00b0 while running, and that\\\\u2019s below freezing. Because it\\\\u2019s below freezing, ice will start to build on the coil outside.\\\\n\\\\nThe heat pump has sensors and a smart control board that detects when there\\\\u2019s too much ice on the coil. It will automatically shift the heat pump from heating mode to cooling mode. When in cooling mode, your indoor coil absorbs heat from inside your house, and runs it through the outside coil. The coil will get above freezing very quickly, and the ice will melt fast. When the board sense that the ice is gone, it will shift the heat pump back into heating.\\\\n\\\\nAt the thermostat, it might say DF or DEF, possibly even Defrost in small lettering. Also, when the heat pump defrosts and kicks the system into cooling, it also kicks on heating elements that are built in to the heat pump. These are usually auxiliary heating, so that if you set the heating temperature to 4\\\\u00b0 or more above the current temperature in the house, the heat pump can heat faster. Those elements also turn on during the defrost cycle so that your unit isn\\\\u2019t blowing cold air into a warm house. This is only for a heat pump, these issues don\\\\u2019t arise for any kind of furnace or strictly AC system.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\u2019s say that you do turn on the AC during winter. What would happen?\\\\n\\\\nFirst, during defrost, the unit goes into cooling. However, the outdoor fan doesn\\\\u2019t run, so the heat in the coil is only used to melt the ice/frost buildup. The refrigerant doesn\\\\u2019t get too cold, so there\\\\u2019s no issue.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you turn the system to cooling, the outdoor fan runs. Because it\\\\u2019s so cold out, too much heat will be removed from the refrigerant. The pressure in the outdoor coil gets too low because the temperature is too low. There isn\\\\u2019t enough pressure to push the refrigerant to the indoor coil. The refrigerant stacks in the outdoor coil, until there\\\\u2019s too much, and it possibly breaks the compressor, or your system stops working because the pressure is too low inside.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s just fine to leave the thermostat set to auto during the winter, as long as there is at least a 3\\\\u00b0 difference between the heating and the cooling temps. All the commercial buildings and houses I work in do it, no issues. Just don\\\\u2019t run the AC during the winter unless you have to, and only for a short time.\\\\n\\\\nHope this helps!\\\\n\\\\n***Edit, add-on*** Another answer has a good tip. IF you have an AC (not a heat pump) with a gas or electric furnace, you can possibly turn off your outdoor unit.\\\\n\\\\nSome AC outdoor units have a crankcase heater. This is a high resistance, low amperage heat strip that wraps around your compressor. Its purpose is to keep the compressor warmer than the inside of your house. The reason for the crankcase heater is to prevent the compressor from filling up with refrigerant.\\\\n\\\\nRefrigerant mixes with the oil in a refrigeration system (AC, heat pump, refrigerator/freezer, etc). Refrigerant also moves to the coldest place in any refrigeration system. During the fall/winter/early spring months, the coldest place in an AC/heat pump system is almost always the outdoor unit. Refrigerant is also a phenomenal cleaner (for metal parts and such).\\\\n\\\\nMost of the refrigerant in your system will reside in the outdoor unit, which is fine. The issue that arises is that, when the system starts with refrigerant in the crankcase of the compressor, the refrigerant will move with the oil. The refrigerant carries the oil away, leaving very little left in the crankcase. The leftover refrigerant will wash oil from moving parts, which can lead to the eventual seizing of the motor.\\\\n\\\\nThe crankcase heater keeps the oil, and compressor, warm enough that most of the refrigerant boils out of the oil. It slowly migrates to a colder location in the system, like the outdoor coil, but stays out of the crankcase. When the compressor starts, it will have mostly oil in the crankcase, and the oil will do its job.\\\\n\\\\nShutting off the outdoor unit on an AC-only system, when it won\\\\u2019t be used for longer periods of time, is just fine. This can save money on power. We\\\\u2019re talking maybe less than a dollar a month, as the resistance of the heaters are usually pretty high. It also saves on the life of the heater.\\\\n\\\\nThis isn\\\\u2019t a possibility on a heat pump because it needs the outdoor unit to work. This also isn\\\\u2019t possible on some AC-only systems. The 24V power for the thermostat, and controls for the AC & furnace, may come from a transformer. The transformer may be located in the outdoor unit, or in the indoor unit. If it\\\\u2019s in the outdoor unit, you will have no power for the thermostat and controls. No transformer, no heat. Make sure that if you shut off the outdoor unit, your thermostat stays on and your heat still runs.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are able to shut off the outdoor unit, and you do so, that is fine. You can leave your thermostat in auto. If for some reason it tries to turn on cooling, nothing will happen. When it\\\\u2019s time to start using your AC again, turn on the outdoor unit. I would wait at least 24 hours before running the AC. This is to allow the crankcase heater to warm up and boil off enough refrigerant in the compressor to prevent damage from occurring.\", \"',\n",

Their absence can help reduce allergy symptoms, while protecting children from childhood asthma caused by mold.\\\\n\\\\n1. They prevent and hinder mould growth\\\\n\\\\nDehumidifiers take away excess humidity in your home, leaving you with drier air. This helps to reduce damp and the associated problems like mould growth and peeling wallpaper. You can find out if your indoor air is too humid by using a hygrometer.\\\\n\\\\nMoulds need moisture to grow. They love the humid conditions found in most homes during this time of year. When the central heating is cranked up and ventilation is compromised by keeping windows closed, moulds thrive. Dehumidifiers take away the essential humidity that mould needs in which to grow.\\\\n\\\\nNHS Choices reports that people living in homes with damp and mould are more likely to develop breathing problems, infections and allergies[1]. Damp and mould is also linked with effects on the immune system. They recommend that particularly sensitive groups like the elderly and the very young, the immune-compromised and those with breathing problems like asthma should not be exposed to damp and mould.\\\\n\\\\nMoulds are a widely underestimated allergy trigger. Mould allergy is a reaction to mould, which is associated with a whole host of unpleasant symptoms. Allergic people have reported panic attacks, wheezing, a runny nose and depression as a result of exposure to mould. Moulds also release MVOCs as they grow, which can cause health problems (especially for those with chemical sensitivity). If you\\\\u2019re concerned about the effects of mould on your health, then see your GP.\\\\n\\\\n2. They inhibit dust mites\\\\n\\\\nDust mites are extremely common and are again a little-understood allergy trigger for many people. Even the cleanest homes harbour dust mites, which tend to lurk in mattresses, upholstery and carpets. These tiny creatures are microscopic; they don\\\\u2019t bite, but they can cause allergy symptoms in certain people.\\\\n\\\\nThey love the warm, humid conditions that domestic environments provide. They need food (such as keratin broken down by fungi) and moisture to survive. They\\\\u2019re prolific in humid environments, so taking away excess moisture can really help to reduce the dust mite population in your home. Remember that you\\\\u2019ll need to combine this with thorough cleaning and dust mite-proofing measures to have a significant effect.\\\\n\\\\n3. They reduce condensation\\\\n\\\\nCondensation is a widespread problem. Cooking, showers and baths can all cause condensation, which in turn can contribute to damp and mould growth. A dehumidifier can help to reduce the effects of this in other rooms of the house.\\\\n\\\\n4. They can help to dry clothing\\\\n\\\\nIf you don\\\\u2019t have a tumble dryer or the weather is not conducive to drying your washing on the line, a dehumidifier can be helpful for speeding up the clothes-drying process. Some models even have a specific laundry-drying function. We wouldn\\\\u2019t recommend this approach if you have a tumble dryer already. Initially you will still be adding excess moisture to the air that wasn\\\\u2019t there before, though the dehumidifier will remove this once the clothes are dry. Dehumidifiers with laundry drying functions can be very useful in homes without laundry drying facilities and rental accommodation.\\\\n\\\\n5. They can protect your home furnishings\\\\n\\\\nExcess moisture can cause furniture and upholstery to harbour mildew. They can develop that characteristic \\\\u2018musty\\\\u2019 smell and feel slightly damp to the touch. A dehumidifier can help to prevent this. Remember if you have antique furniture or woodwork, be careful not to let the air get too dry.

       "   3: ': \"Air purifiers work to fully eliminate odors and the causes of odors, rather than simply masking unpleasant smells. Odors are created by microscopic molecules in the air from a multitude of sources, such as pets, cooking, tobacco, or firewood smoke. Air purifiers capture and eliminate these molecules during the filtration process.\\\\n\\\\nNormally, air purifiers filter air through a HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filter. This filter excels in catching large molecules like pet hair and dander. However, smaller molecules, the ones responsible for odors, are able to slip through a solely HEPA filtration system.\\\\n\\\\nFor true odor management, a secondary filtration system is required. This second system is composed of activated carbon, also known as charcoal. Activated carbon removes the molecules responsible for unpleasant odors through a process called adsorption. Think of activated carbon as a sponge; it grabs odor molecules from the air, bonds to them, and holds them within the filtration system.\\\\n\\\\nAn air purifier with an activated carbon filter differs from other odor management solutions. Rather than adding molecules to the air in attempt to mask odor, air purifiers with carbon remove molecules from the air. Essentially, the difference in odor management methods is the same as the difference between addition and subtraction: they\\\\u2019re completely different processes.\\\\n\\\\nAdding molecules to the air to mask odors can have unintended consequences, most notably the addition of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) to your indoor air. Air fresheners often contain Formaldehyde, classified as a carcinogen, that could induce nausea and headaches or aggravate asthma. Another common VOC are phthalates, hazardous chemicals that can induce birth defects and hormonal abnormalities.\\\\n\\\\nSome air purifiers perform better than others depending on where the odor originates from. Depending on your price range and room size, there are a multitude of air purifier options for odor control.

They produce stylish and design-conscious air purifiers without sacrificing performance. Alen offers four different filtration options to cover all needs. For smoke and odors, I recommend the FreshPlus filter.\\\\n\\\\n1. Alen BreatheSmart for Smoke and Odors [ http://www.air-purifiers-america.com/products/alen-breathesmart-for-smoke-odors ] - provides coverage up to 1100 sq. feet and comes in 15 different colors.

Unlike an air purifier, they do not aggregate particles that are smaller than the holes to ensure they become trapped in the media or settle out of the air you breathe.\\\\n\\\\nAnother shortcoming of air filters is that they do not oxidize the various gasses that commonly get into indoor air and they do not oxidize biological pollutants. Biological contaminants can include cold and flu viruses, mold spores, bacteria, dust mite pellets, cat dander, and a variety of other unhealthy things that can be inhaled and affect your health.\\\\n\\\\nA true air purification system is not reliant upon air filter media to purify indoor air.

       "   6: ': \"Short answer is it depends upon what you need the air purifier to remove and how much you want to spend.  I\\'ve been in the air purifier industry for more than 14 years and can tell you there is a lot of misinformation and slick marketing.\\\\n\\\\nRather than list specific models which may not be relevant for you, I will give you the lay of the land to give you the tools to make the decision that is best for you.\\\\n\\\\nFirst you need to consider what you want the air purifier to do.  For particulates (dust, pollen, mold spores, pet dander, etc) a HEPA filter is the best technology.  There are some other technologies like electrostatic, ionizers, etc that claim to remove particulates but are really a waste of money and not effective.  \\\\n\\\\nMany brands claim to have HEPA filters or true HEPA filters and technically they do not all reach the HEPA standard.  True HEPA filters are not cheap to make and you typically get what you pay for with the filters.\\\\n\\\\nSome people also want gas removal.  This would be odors, chemical fumes, smoke odors, etc.  Gases are more difficult since there is not one technology that is effective for all.  Activated carbon is good for a wide spectrum of gases however is not good for formaldehyde and does not work as well in humid environments.  For this you need an additional media like potassium permanganate.\\\\n\\\\nWhile you are thinking about an air purifier to improve your air quality there are some technologies that introduce pollution which is the opposite of what you want.  This would be any technology that produces ozone or other dangerous gases.  Ozone is a lung irritant and thanks to the CA EPA there are now regulations that have taken many of these products off of the market.  Ionization units can also produce ozone.  PCO (photocatalytic oxidation) can as well.  The safest is to choose a system that uses only mechanical filtration.  That is, just a HEPA or carbon filter or the ability to turn off other technologies.\\\\n\\\\nIn it\\'s simplest form an air purifier is a filter, motor/fan and housing.  Some companies promote the use of multiple technologies or multiple filtration levels.  This is all marketing hype.  What really matters is the quality and quantity of the HEPA filters and the quality of the motor/fan.\\\\n\\\\nThere is a standard to size air purifiers.  This is called CADR (clean air delivery rate).  For a 160 sq ft room you would want a CADR of at least 110.  CADR is a metric that reflects the filtered air flow.  You need to clean the air with a decent filter and move sufficient volumes of air to clean the room effectively.  110 CADR is low number so most air purifiers should meet this requirement although the CADR is measured at the highest fan speed and I have not seen an air purifier yet that quiet on the highest speed.  So, you may want to consider something with a CADR closer to 200 so you can run it on a lower fan speed.\\\\n\\\\nThere are some other issues with the CADR metric such as it doesn\\'t reflect performance over time, doesn\\'t reflect noise level and doesn\\'t measure performance for the smallest sized particles which are the most dangerous however it is the best metric we currently have.\\\\n\\\\nAnother consideration is the filter life.  Air purifier filters that require replacement every 6 months tend to be very expensive over time as the filter costs can quickly surpass the cost of the air purifier. \", \"',\n",

A True HEPA filter can trap dust, mold, smoke, pet allergens, PM2.5 (dangerous particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller), and even bacteria and viruses\\\\u2026 which is exactly why the CDC has recommended them for help in slowing the spread of COVID-19.\\\\n\\\\nCOVID is about .12 microns. Particles of that size are eliminated through a phenomena known as Brownian Motion in which tiny particles bounce wildly off of other larger particles in the air in random patterns that send them careening off into different directions. It\\\\u2019s these zigzag patterns that cause them to hit the fibers of the HEPA filter and get stuck.\\\\n\\\\nWhile mask wearing and social distancing are still the best ways to stay safe from COVID, if you have to share indoor space with others, a purifier with the HEPA seal can help ensure that your air is COVID-free.\", \"',\n",

It is really a collection of half truths and implications.\\\\n\\\\nRemember the tome - an ounce of prevention?\\\\n\\\\nAir in the house contains dust particulates, pollutants such as VOCs spores , bacteria etc in small quantities, chemicals ang gases. Air is pulled in through return air ducts, pulled through air filters, then a finned heat/cool coil heat exchanger and/or combustion heat exchanger and a blower fan (exact order may be different) and then blown through discharge ducts and out through diffusers. Throughout the system the air is moving about 10ft per second with considerable turbulence.\\\\n\\\\nDust etc is entrained in the airflow of the return air (PA grilles are usually located on the lower walls of rooms) so very little can be deposited on the duct surfaces and remain there normally. At the air handler all air should go through the filters. Choose the highest MERV value compatible with your unit - usually between 11 and 13 in newer equipment. The filters should also contain carbon and electrostatic media. BTW MERV 13 is hospital grade removing particles to smaller that 5 micron, while the carbon media removes VOCs and gases. Make sure there are cover plates on the end of filter racks so no air can bypass the filters. Most particulates are caught and washed by the fined coils or burned by contact in a burner heat exchanger.\\\\n\\\\nNot much left to deal with in the supply ducts so why , after several years do you see dust and dirt accumulate on diffusers? The answer is VOCs from cooking They fill all the rooms of the house with chemicals that condense on all surfaces - most never went through the HVAC system at all.\\\\n\\\\nThe idea that bacteria and mold is lurking in the ductwork is silly. Biologicals require food and water - scant supply in dry steel ducts. Only place is the condensate pan where water can sit and there is a constant supply or particles washing off the fins. An annual tab of mildicide placed in the pad eliminates that possibility.\\\\n\\\\nWhat you are left with then, is chemically cleaning the evaporator and condenser coils every 5 years or so, annual condensate tab and two month filter changes.

If you are spending time cleaning your own office or delegating cleaning duties to your staff, you are losing time, money, and productivity. It can also lower morale in the office. Your staff does not want to clean the toilet, they want to do what they were hired to do. Let your staff do what they are best at, and leave the cleaning to the professionals.\\\\n\\\\nWhen your office or retail space is clean, dust free and properly sanitized it can cut down on germs and your staff will be less likely to get sick. If your staff is out sick it puts a strain on the rest of the staff and could lower productivity. A clean and healthy environment leads to a happy office staff.\\\\n\\\\nYou will appreciate your work space, office or retail space even more. When you work in a clean, organized environment, it leads to a more productive office staff.

They only work well with (a) very light bather loads, (b) cool climates [water less than 80 deg F] and (c) excellent design and installation. \\\\n\\\\nThis means MOST \\\\u201cnatural\\\\u201d pools end up failing.\\\\n2.

It is not the heat that eats the chlorine, it is the UV rays and everything else in your pool (leaves, people, dirt). But, too much cynaric acid is just as not having enough. 30 to 50 ppm is an ideal level.\\\\n\\\\nTDS also will hinder your pool chemicals. Imagine getting a glass of water and putting 2 tablespoons of sugar in there. Stir it up and it dissolves. But what happens when you keep adding sugar? Soon, it will just sink to the bottom.

Whether ashore or aboard ship, cleaning is carried-on like lives depended on it. Which they do.\\\\n\\\\nThe following is an excerpt from this reference, which is dated and may have been superseded: https://iwrc.uni.edu/sites/default/files/Cleaning_Corrosion_Control_vII_Aircraft.pdf\\\\n\\\\nINTRODUCTION. Cleaning is the first step in preventing aircraft corrosion and wear. Dirt, salt air deposits, and other contaminants can promote rapid corrosion and wear of aircraft surfaces, and can have an adverse impact on aircraft systems performance. Effective cleaning requires knowledge of the appropriate materials and methods needed to remove these contaminants.\\\\n\\\\nREASONS FOR CLEANING. Aircraft should be cleaned regularly in order to: \\\\na. Prevent corrosion by removing salt deposits, other corrosive soils, and electrolytes; \\\\nb. Maintain visibility through canopies and windows; \\\\nc. Allow a thorough inspection for corrosion and corrosion damage; \\\\nd. Maintain turbine engine efficiency; \\\\ne. Reduce fire hazards by the removal of accumulations of leaking fluids; \\\\nf. Improve overall appearance; \\\\ng. Ensure aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft; and \\\\nh. Maintain special paint scheme characteristics.\\\\n\\\\nFREQUENCY OF CLEANING. All aircraft shall be cleaned according to schedules required by the parent service organization. Navy aircraft shall be cleaned in accordance with the schedule in the aircraft specific manual. In the absence of aircraft specific requirements, Navy aircraft shall be cleaned at least every 7 days when aboard ship and at least every 14 days when ashore. Army requirements are given in Appendix B. Under certain conditions, depending on the type of aircraft and usage, the normal wash cycle may not be sufficient. More frequent cleaning may be required for certain types of aircraft when: \\\\na. Excessive exhaust gases or gun blast soils accumulate within impingement areas; \\\\nb. Paint is peeling, flaking, or softening; \\\\nc. Fluid leakage (coolant, hydraulic fluid, or oil) occurs; or \\\\nd. Exposure to salt spray, salt water, or other corrosive materials occurs.\\\\n\\\\n2-3.1. DAILY CLEANING. When deployed within three miles of salt water or when flown below 3000 feet over salt water, daily cleaning or wipe down is required on all exposed, unpainted surfaces, such as landing gear struts and actuating rods of hydraulic cylinders. NOTE Optimum use of taxi-through rinse facilities is recommended for removal of salt contamination and light soils when operating near sea water. Rinsing does not satisfy aircraft washing requirements, it only removes readily soluble matter from exterior surfaces.\\\\n\\\\n2-3.2. IMMEDIATE CLEANING. Affected areas must be cleaned immediately if:\\\\na. Spilled electrolyte and corrosive deposits are found around battery terminals and battery area;\\\\nb. Aircraft are exposed to corrosive fire extinguishing materials;\\\\nc. Salt deposits, relief tube waste, or other corrosive contaminants are apparent;\\\\nd. Aircraft are exposed to significant amounts of salt water;\\\\ne. Fungus growth is apparent; or\\\\nf. Chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) contaminants are detected.\", \"',\n",
       "   2: ': \"\\\\n%3E Do US Navy aircraft carriers have to be significantly dismantled to expose the reactor for mid-life refueling?\\\\nWhat many people don\\\\u2019t realize is that when a ship is built its entire service life is planned out. For military vessels this includes possible upgrades and major maintenance.\\\\n\\\\nHere is an image for the USS Enterprise at the Newport News Shipyard as it was being prepared for decommissioning.\\\\n\\\\nHere is a closer view of the important part.\\\\n\\\\nHere is a image of the USS George Washington currently undergoing a Refueling and Complex Overhaul.\\\\n\\\\nNote the square hatches along the center-line of the flight deck. Those are the reactor access points. They are not permanent hatches, but are areas designed to be removed and replaced in a shipyard. They are cut open for maintenance then welded closed when the work is done. The important information to note is that the path between the flight deck and reactor compartment has no significant structure in it. The ship is designed for the plates for each deck to be removed to open the access shaft.\\\\n\\\\nIt is very common for ships to have portions temporarily cut out during heavy maintenance.\\\\n\\\\nNote: The Enterprise was built with eight reactors because they were essentially used to replace the boilers in the existing conventional carrier design. This added enough to the cost that the Nimitz and later designs only use two larger reactors. This complexity has added significantly to the cost of disposal of the Enterprise.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"Fourteen. If you don\\\\u2019t include the LHAs and LHDs.\\\\n\\\\nThis sounds unaffordable, and if the US stuck to its current policy of only running 100,000 ton nuclear behemoths it would be. Not only that, but the US can\\\\u2019t build supercarriers fast enough to reach fourteen in less than 60 years without new shipbuilding facilities. Because the supercarriers can only just maintain station 25% of the time [1], to achieve three constantly-available carriers requires the current target of twelve in total, and even getting to that number is proving exceptionally difficult. The US currently has only ten operational, so how can fourteen be the right number?\\\\n\\\\nI think the US needs to run a mix of small, medium and large carriers. By small, I mean the emergency use of the America and Wasp class amphibious craft. The US has already been forced down this route when no supercarriers were available, employing USS Essex in the carrier strike role.\\\\n\\\\nUSS Essex, LHD-2.\\\\n\\\\nWasp-class LHDs have a fraction of the strike capacity of a supercarrier. At most they can operate about 12 strike aircraft, more normally that would be six. Although USS America, is about the same size as a Wasp, it has been modified to allow as many as 20 strike aircraft to operate if other functions such as helicopter operations are offloaded. That\\\\u2019s useful, but still not a direct replacement.\\\\n\\\\nAt the other end of the scale lie the Nimitz-class supercarriers and their Ford-class successors. These can comfortably run 60 strike craft without sacrificing their ability to also host tanker aircraft for extended range, AEW and command and control aircraft such as the E-2D, electronic warfare specialised aircraft, and search and rescue helicopters. They function at a whole different level.\\\\n\\\\nUSS Nimitz\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately the cost of running supercarriers is at a whole different level too. Every time a Nimitz class carrier requires a mid-life refuel and overhaul, the prospect of spending billions to take the ship out of service for four years promotes calls for the ship\\\\u2019s early retirement. But the Wasps and Americas are simply not up to the job of replacing a supercarrier in any but the most trivial cases. As long as there\\\\u2019s no credible alternative, the Nimitz carriers can\\\\u2019t be retired early and the billions have to be spent.\\\\n\\\\nI would argue there is an alternative, just not one the USN likes to think about: the medium sized carrier. The best current example of this is the Royal Navy\\\\u2019s Queen Elizabeth class.\\\\n\\\\nHMS Queen Elizabeth.\\\\n\\\\nThe USN will take one look at the 65,000 ton, 36-strike-plane HMS Queen Elizabeth, shake its collective head and say it\\\\u2019s no good for them. It\\\\u2019s just an oversized STOVL (short take-off) carrier, incapable of launching any of their current carrier-based planes. Without the ability to host the USN\\\\u2019s carrier wings, how is it any use? However, the Queen Elizabeth class can be built with catapults and arrestors. It can run as a STOVL, STOBAR, CATOBAR or hybrid class. Just because Britain has chosen to go STOVL doesn\\\\u2019t mean America needs to. A slightly heavier 70,000 ton CATOBAR arrangement would suit the USN far better.\\\\n\\\\nCATOBAR configuration of Queen Elizabeth class carriers.\\\\n\\\\nThe second issue is that in a higher threat environment, half the multi-role fighters of a medium-sized carrier would need to be dedicated to defence, leaving a much reduced strike capability. So basing a carrier group around a CATOBAR QE class ship will not give anything like the same power punch as a Nimitz or a Ford. This is a valid issue, especially as HMS Queen Elizabeth\\\\u2019s fast sortie rate would be somewhat reduced when configured as a CATOBAR ship. This too is easily answered. QE class ships cost less than half of the Nimitz class to build and maybe a fifth of their cost to run. So for high threat environments the carrier group should contain two medium-sized carriers. With over seventy strike aircraft and twenty-five auxiliaries/helicopters, two QE class carriers match the USS Ford and possibly exceed it.\\\\n\\\\nThe third issue is that they aren\\\\u2019t nuclear powered. The QE class houses less internal space for weapons and aircraft fuel. So a Nimitz will carry maybe four and a half times the quantity of jet fuel as a single QE. This means the conventionally powered carrier needs more fleet tankers and solid supply ships to be made available. Logistics become tougher. Building a nuclear powered medium-sized carrier would be a mistake. The cost advantages would disappear and two carriers would no longer save money. The extra auxiliaries are part of the cost of the operations, and still don\\\\u2019t increase costs to anything like that of a Nimitz-based group.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the flank speed of the Nimitz class is faster than that of a QE class, around 36 knots to QE\\\\u2019s 32 knots, that\\\\u2019s less to do with the nuclear power source and more to do with a Nimitz having twice the number of propellors. It also doesn\\\\u2019t materially affect operations. I add the comment as some believe that nuclear is somehow necessarily faster. They should watch the French nuclear carrier if they believe that.\\\\n\\\\nAnother issue often brought up is robustness. A medium-sized carrier is inherently more likely to be damaged by a missile strike, and papers have cited vastly inflated costs associated with mitigating that risk. I believe this is a red herring. The level of redundancy of two Queen Elizabeth class carriers more than makes up for any increased propensity to take damage. A single hit to the arrestors or the catapult electrical system could render a Ford class carrier inoperable, whereas a lucky strike to a QE class carrier would leave at least 50% capacity in the form of other ship. Also, the ability of even one of the double-island QE carriers to weather a hit to the superstructure is greater than that of a Nimitz/Ford class.\\\\n\\\\nA major upside of medium-conventional is that they can be forward based more easily, increasing availabilty. While the US is fortunate to have such a base in Japan for one nuclear carrier group, no such facilities are available to the Second, Fifth or Sixth fleets. This means carriers destined for the North East Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf have to spend a considerable percentage of a six month deployment getting to and from their stations. This is a significant part of the reason for their sub-25% availability. A forward-based conventional carrier can achieve availability rates over 33%, so three ships can take the place of four. Forward basing has cost implications, but the increased availability more than makes up for that.\\\\n\\\\nBecause we are doubling up numbers to maintain power projection, the US would need six forward-based medium conventional carriers to take the place of four nuclear supercarriers. And we finally get to my recommended number of fourteen: eight Ford/Nimitz nuclear carriers plus six conventional 70,000 tons carriers, to be forward based in the Mediterranean.\\\\n\\\\nThe considerable cost savings are only one reason to go down this route. Another is flexibility. A carrier group can be centred on a single medium carrier for lower threat operations (as is more typically found in the Mediterranean), doubling the ability to provide lower level operations. Rather than three conflicts, the US could potentially cover four without surging, the two lower level being handled by separated medium carriers, especially if one or both is paired with a LHD/LHA.\\\\n\\\\n[Flexibility could be increased still further if three of the medium carriers are CATOBAR and three are hybrid (two catapults and one ramp each). A heterogeneous pairing would allow increased interoperability with the USMC and wings of F-35Bs on the hybrid could mix with F-35C and F/A-18s on the CATOBAR. This would have to be wargamed to see if the different options would be worth it. I would have thought not, except that mixing up capabilities is seen doctrinally as a \\\\u201cgood thing\\\\u201d \\\\u2014 it keeps an enemy guessing at to the capabilities it might be facing.]\\\\n\\\\nA final advantage is that only one place in the US can construct Nimitz/Ford class carriers, the Huntington Ingalls shipyard in Norfolk News. This isn\\\\u2019t true of medium-sized conventional carriers, which can be built in parallel to the Ford class at other sites. Replacing some of the Nimitz class carriers with conventional ones on a two for one basis would allow the target capability to be reached faster than with twelve supercarriers. If half were built in Newport News and half in Mississippi (where HI build the LHAs) this would allow solid continuity of skills in both locations and stronger skills transfer between the two sites.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1.

Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_aircraft_carrier_Shandong ]can carry up to 32, but has the same type of limitations.\\\\n\\\\nThe Shenyang J-15 - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang_J-15 ] is not the latest and greatest. Its also compromised by being launched off a carrier, so will have limited armaments and fuel load. Enough to deter a smaller number of equally out of date and compromised aircraft, particularly at their maximum range. In Asia (excluding the US) this is still highly significant and powerful, particularly against countries that may only own and operate ~24 fighters in total. Particularly when backed up by bombers and other land based aircraft.\\\\n\\\\nBut none of these are going to go anywhere near Japan, that northern Asian space is heavily contested, and bringing a carrier in range of land based fighters is a big no no.\\\\n\\\\nJapanese carriers\\\\n\\\\nJapan originally built both ships (Izumo-class helicopter destroyer - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izumo-class_helicopter_destroyer ] JS Kaga - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JS_Kaga ])to serve as ASW ships. That is search and destroy submarines. They have a very large bow sonar, a towed array, they can operate a large number of helicopters, which would then using a combination of dipping sonar, sonobuoy [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonobuoy ]s, and helicopters and planes armed with torpedoes, as well as ASROC armed escorts, put tremendous pressure on submarines to leave or be destroyed.\\\\n\\\\nAs such, they are very annoying for the opposition. They become priority targets. As such the ideal platform to attack them is long ranged aircraft with long ranged munitions.\\\\n\\\\nSomething like a Xian H-6 - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_H-6 ] or Xi\\'an JH-7 - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_JH-7 ]. Old and slow, as bombers are, but with great range, that can be land based, and strike very far away.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, by allowing a few F-35B\\\\u2019s to land, refuel, perhaps even sit on deck this complicates things dramatically for the opposition. Their bomber will never get within weapon range with F-35\\\\u2019s able to fly off the deck or operating at an extended range from the ships location. While these aircraft may be land based, having the option to land and take off from the ship significantly improves persistence and time in theatre. It also results in a much stronger response if a threat was to come in, than if you were relying on a few planes based from land bases far away and being refueled constantly.\\\\n\\\\nNow you would need to bring escorts, more, much more than what is deployed on the carrier, or can be surged from the mainland. This then becomes a huge impost on the attacker. You have to ask yourself how much do you need and is it worth it. The risk goes up considerably.\\\\n\\\\nSay there are six F-35B\\\\u2019s on the Izumo, ready to go, one in the air, and a flight of 6 x F-35B\\\\u2019s back closer towards Japan.\\\\n\\\\nHow many Chinese fighters do you need to take down that initial potentially 6 F-35\\\\u2019s and can they do it before another 6 arrives from the mainland?\\\\n\\\\nThe F-35 is a very good, very new aircraft. It will be hard to shoot down. It would be very easy for them to shoot down something like the J-15 or J11. If its a land based aircraft, how much range would be left for maneuvering and fighting when you get there? You are talking multiple squadrons, at least, of the very best fighters China has (the Chengdu J-20 - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_J-20 ]? or the Shenyang J-16 - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenyang_J-16 ]).\\\\n\\\\nThe PLA-N will then need the PLA-AF aircraft. On a very risky mission, they would have to risk all their high value aircraft. On a mission they are very much not suited for.\\\\n\\\\nTLDR\\\\n\\\\nJapan doesn\\\\u2019t need many aircraft on their ship to make the enemy have to spend a huge amount of resources to plan an attack. Its unlikely they will even deploy 12 on the ship, most likely %3C6 with it also operating helicopters to hunt down submarines. The F-35\\\\u2019s would be there to deter enemy fighters in attacking it while it performs its mission. It is also likely to still be operating under the range of land based aircraft, including F-35\\\\u2019s, F-15\\\\u2019s and P1\\\\u2019s. The additional aircraft embarked are just force multipliers, and other land based F-35B\\\\u2019s will also likely contribute to airspace sanitation.\\\\n\\\\nKorea seems to be thinking along similar lines, speculation that Australia\\\\u2019s already F-35B capable LHD could perform a similar mission, if it was deemed a requirement.\", \"',\n",

       "   7: ': \"Allow me to reframe the question by saying this: The Japanese had to make do with what they had, and they did a wonderful job overall.\\\\n\\\\nJapan and America started the war differently. Japan had a shock transition from feudalism to industrial age not a century before. By the 30s and 40s, they were going full steam ahead in building heavy industries to be on par with Western nations.\\\\n\\\\nAmerica on the other hand was already an economic and industrial powerhouse then. They had the big cities, factories, and large population of technically-minded adults.\\\\n\\\\nAccess to resources is also very different. The whole Japanese imperial expansion was motivated by them to gain access to resources they lacked in Japan, like rubber and oil. America, meanwhile, was already rich in resources.\\\\n\\\\nThe Japanese engineers got the short end of the stick, so to speak. They had to work with many more constraints than their American counterparts. For example, the Japanese Zero fighter was so light not only to meet range and maneuverability requirements, but also because the Japanese didn\\\\u2019t have powerful aircraft motors.\\\\n\\\\nBy the end of the war, the Japanese were deprived of almost everything. At that point, they had to resort to making disposable airplanes for Kamikaze because that was all they could do. It certainly didn\\\\u2019t help that their factories get bombed frequently. Still, despite all that they managed to make a few great airplanes. The N1K Shinden Kai (picture below) was a late-war Japanese fighter that could match all frontline US fighters.

       "   9: ': \"What the Papers Say\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a lot of commentary from different defence-focused journals and blogs on the issue of the best size of carrier, and I don\\\\u2019t think the final word for the coming decades has been written.\\\\n\\\\nWhen people talk about a \\\\u201clight carrier\\\\u201d they mean different things. To the Royal Navy, that\\\\u2019s something displacing around 18\\\\u201328,000 tons like an Invincible class carrier of the early 80s, built for the Sea Harrier. Or the post WW2 Centaur class \\\\u201clight fleet carrier\\\\u201d, first converted to CATOBAR, then as armoured planes grew heavier and the catapults couldn\\\\u2019t cope, repurposed.\\\\n\\\\nTo the US Navy a \\\\u201clight carrier\\\\u201d means an amphibious warship, an LHA or LHD, such as the Wasp, Tarawa or America class. That\\\\u2019s because the US Navy hasn\\\\u2019t built what the British would call a light carrier since the 1930s. The Wasp and Tarawa class LHDs are 40,000 tons and aren\\\\u2019t supposed to be aircraft carriers by anyone\\\\u2019s doctrine. They ferry troops and equipment, protected by their aircraft. An aircraft carrier\\\\u2019s job is to ferry and protect the aircraft.\\\\n\\\\nLook at the difference between the modern USS America amphibious attack ship, and the USS America carrier built in the 1960s:\\\\n\\\\n * USS America, LHA-6 amphious assault: ferries 1,687 marines at 22 knots (protected by 20 aircraft).\\\\n * USS America, CV-66 former aircraft carrier: ferried 79 aircraft at 34 knots (along with no marines).\\\\nBut you can fly fighters from LHAs, and they look like carriers, big ships with flat tops; a layman\\\\u2019s eye can hardly tell the difference. So the Navy gets sick of telling people they aren\\\\u2019t really carriers. And they aren\\\\u2019t, but if it were that simple, I\\\\u2019d have already stopped writing.\\\\n\\\\nAre world navies seriously considering sailing light aircraft carriers?\\\\n\\\\nFor Italy and Japan it\\\\u2019s a done deal. Italy\\\\u2019s Cavour and Japan\\\\u2019s Izumo class are the modern ships closest to the British definition of light carriers (although Japan\\\\u2019s are officially called multi-purpose destroyers).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if we follow the question back to the National Interest article that prompted it: Why World Navies Are Seriously Considering Sailing Light Aircraft Carriers [ https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-world-navies-are-seriously-considering-sailing-light-aircraft-carriers-117926 ], it\\\\u2019s really talking about amphibious attack ships that use the F-35B Lightning II.\\\\n\\\\nThe F-35, America\\\\u2019s latest and possibly greatest multi-purpose fighter, comes in three variants. The F35B is the only one that can use amphibious attack ships (LHA/LHDs), as well as almost any size carrier, including helicopter carriers. Like its Harrier jump-jet predecessor, it can take off vertically, but it lifts more payload when using a short runway on the deck, which can be made even shorter when aided by a ramp.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cThe world\\\\u201d doesn\\\\u2019t use the F-35B on amphibious ships, partly because the US is particular who gets them, but mostly because only a dozen countries can afford the ships in the first place. Turkey won\\\\u2019t be using them on its new amphibious flattop because of a dispute with the US. Australia won\\\\u2019t because they prefer helicopters. South Korea have a programme LPX-II, but no go ahead. Which leaves Japan and Italy who will, and Spain still considering whether upgrade their Harriers. Hardly the world. (Russia, China, India, France, Brazil and Egypt have the ships, and it\\\\u2019s still never gonna happen. Sorry, Thailand \\\\u2014 too small.)\\\\n\\\\nBut threre\\\\u2019s one more country, the one the article\\\\u2019s really about: the good old USA.\\\\n\\\\nDavid Axe, the article\\\\u2019s author, quotes the UK Defence Journal as saying the Royal Navy is right to avoid light carriers, glossing over the point that UKJD means a different beast. Axe goes on to say that the US Navy disagrees because the USS Wasp is being trialled as Lightning Carrier. He ignores another point: it\\\\u2019s not the US Navy trying this out, even though they own the ship; the Navy brass hates Lightning Carriers. The innovation is being driven by the US Marine Corps.\\\\n\\\\nSo what\\\\u2019s special about an American Lightning Carrier?\\\\n\\\\nThe primary aircraft of amphibious assault flattops has always been the helicopter. LHDs have floodable well decks to launch landing craft, carrying troops and equipment to shore. Helicopters also provide transport, as well as maintaining aerial assault cover. But the Harrier\\\\u2019s ability to use small decks changed that. It allowed the Marines to provide their own fixed wing cover without Navy carriers. They fell in love with the British plane and made it their own.\\\\n\\\\nIn the seventies Marine Harriers operated from a Navy carrier [ https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-time-when-av-8-harriers-deployed-aboard-a-fixed-win-1692022146 ], successfully integrating catapult-launched and short takeoff operations on a US ship for the first and last time. It may have been successful militarily, but politically it proved disasterous. Would the Marine Corps lose its Harriers to the Navy, would the Navy lose its catapults? Both services backed away and agreed never to do it again.\\\\n\\\\nThe Marine Corps played around with the idea of dedicating one of the amphibious attack ships just to Harriers, a Harrier Carrier, like foreigners had. The Navy was short of supercarrier power, and the Marines thought, we can do airstrikes too. Decades later the Navy was still short of carrier power and the amphibious ships USS Kearsarge and USS Boxer [ https://navaltoday.com/2016/04/06/us-navy-amphibious-groups-swap-areas-of-operation/ ] got to lead Harrier strikes against Iraq, but the idea has never been pushed as far as the Marines wanted.\\\\n\\\\nThe Lightning Carrier is a Harrier Carrier using the Marines\\\\u2019 latest pride and joy, the F-35B Lightning II. They\\\\u2019re getting F-35Cs too, but that\\\\u2019s more of a reluctant Navy thing. The USMC declared their baby operational in 2015, a year before even the Air Force managed it for the simpler F-35A, while the F-35C won\\\\u2019t be deployed on the Navy\\\\u2019s supercarriers until 2021. The Navy finally reckoned it had initial operational capability last year \\\\u2014 only after Marine F-35B airstrikes on the Taliban.\\\\n\\\\nUSS Essex that struck at the Taliban is a Wasp class LHD, and like the Essex, the USS Wasp normally carries maybe six fixed wing aircraft (Harriers or Lightnings). Last year Wasp led a beefed-up amphibious group with ten F-35Bs and a destroyer escort. The Marines want to push the envelope.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the Wasp class is too limited.\\\\n\\\\nThe Marines wanted to build some newer amphibious flattops optimised for the F-35B. They were allowed to have two ships with a bigger hangar and munitions store in place of the well deck, but had to sign an agreement [ https://breakingdefense.com/2012/10/navys-newest-lha-6-a-dead-end-for-amphibious-ships/ ] that two was it and then they\\\\u2019d stop pushing. These two are the in-service USS America, and the USS Tripoli expected to be commissioned later this year. And even they aren\\\\u2019t as optimised as they could be.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s no ramp. The Navy claim it\\\\u2019s because a ramp would take up a couple of helicopter spots, compromising the amphibious attack capability. However a fully loaded F-35B needs to taxi down the whole of the ship to take off without a ramp. A 40m ramp at the front would free 150m at the back. The Navy logic only holds if there are no Lightnings on ships supposedly designed for them. It has also been called a balancing of the air vs ground of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force. However, conspiracy theorists claim the real reason is to weaken the Marines\\\\u2019 Lightning Carriers, ensuring the dominance of the Navy\\\\u2019s supercarriers \\\\u2014 Navy rivalry keeping Marines in their place.\\\\n\\\\n[And there goes half the readership who\\\\u2019ve made it this far. This answer\\\\u2019s making me no friends.]\\\\n\\\\nIf the USS Wasp maxes out at about twelve F35B Lightnings, USS America could manage twenty. That\\\\u2019s more than any ship anywhere other than Britain\\\\u2019s new 70,000 ton Queen Elizabeth class.\\\\n\\\\nHow good might an America class Lightning Carrier be? Can Light compare to Medium or Heavy?.\\\\n\\\\nThe National Interest claims that the USS America would be capable of 40 F-35 sorties in a fourteen hour day, whereas the supercarrier USS Ford should manage 160 daily sorties, the figure for a sustained period of a month or more. By comparing it seems the claim is that the USS America can sustain a sortie rate of forty a day, not just as a one off.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s huge. In 2011 the French carrier Charles de Gaulle sustained 11 sorties a day over Libya for several months, with eighteen jets, one AEW and some helicopters. Are the Marines claiming the F-35B might be so good, an amphibious attack craft can nearly quadruple the sortie rate of a nuclear-powered catapult-equipped carrier of the same displacement?\\\\n\\\\nYes. It seems they are. Or at least were. The USMC in its 2017 Marine Aviation Plan  [ https://www.aviation.marines.mil/Portals/11/2017%20MARINE%20AVIATIOIN%20PLAN.pdf ]stated:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n%3E \\\\u201c\\\\u2026a Lightning Carrier, taking full advantage of the amphibious assault ship as a sea base, can provide the naval and joint force with significant access, collection and strike capabilities.\\\\\"\\\\nThis is the USMC plan for a 14 hour flight day, with only 16 F-35Bs, one search and rescue helicopter, and with MV-22 (tiltrotor) refuelling coming from a forward operating base. If you count the sorties, there are 42 per day, not including the helicopter. [12 recon; 16 offensive air support; 6 counter air; 8 anti-air defences.]\\\\n\\\\nThis seems optimistic to my untutored eye, but you have to applaud the enthusiasm.\\\\n\\\\n * To achieve the 120 sorties a day theoretical maximum sustained sorties, a USS Nimitz would use 80 aircraft flying a 12 hour operations day. That\\\\u2019s 1.5 sorties per plane day. (A 44-fighter airwing can give 66 strike sorties).\\\\n * HMS Queen Elizabeth would use 36 F-35B to achieve 72 sustained sorties a day. That\\\\u2019s 2 fixed-wing sorties per plane day.\\\\n * USS Ford is attempting 160 sorties in a 12-hour day with a 75 plane airwing. That\\\\u2019s 2.13 sorties per plane day.\\\\n * USS America is looking at 16 F-35Bs for 42 sorties per 14 hour day. That\\\\u2019s 2.625 fixed wing sorties per plane day.\\\\nIf amphibious attack ship USS America can achieve more sorties per plane per day than the purpose-built carriers, it would smash into tiny pieces the accepted carrier wisdom that size brings efficiency. I think it\\\\u2019s possible that the Marines means to fly 16 of 20 loaded F-35Bs each day, which would give a still very impressive 2.1 fixed wing sorties per plane day, putting it on a par with the larger carriers.\\\\n\\\\nIs that Realistic? Exercises vs War.\\\\n\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s a marked difference between sortie rates for certification trials, exercises and warfare. The numbers quoted are really for exercises, but that\\\\u2019s true for all the ships, allowing meaningful comparisons between them.\\\\n\\\\nGood figures are available for the Nimitz class. For example, when undergoing its first flight deck certification in 2009, USS Bush completed 695 catapult sorties in 11 days, 63 per day. A typical modern Nimitz set-up uses 53 fixed wing aircraft (44 F-18 fighters, 5 electronic attack aircraft, 4 early warning aircraft). So that\\\\u2019s 1.2 sorties per plane day.\\\\n\\\\nThe more practised USS Nimitz in the NATO exercise Dawn Patrol, carried out over 1800 sorties in 13 days, that\\\\u2019s 140 sorties a day, including helicopters.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, in a war, Nimitz launched 4,500 sorties over 9 weeks, that\\\\u2019s a higher than wartime average of 71.5 sorties a day \\\\u2014 half the exercise figure.\\\\n\\\\nDesert Storm saw the highest ever number of sustained sorties from a Nimitz class. USS Theodore Roosevelt, delivered 4200 sorties over 45 days at about 93 sorties per day. Roosevelt carried 90 planes. So that\\\\u2019s still just over 1.0 sorties per aircraft per day. That\\\\u2019s been a fairly consistent value from Korea (before Nimitz) to Syria. About 1.0 for sustained strike operations from a carrier. Or worse. It\\\\u2019s often worse.\\\\n\\\\nAll sorts of things are different in war to the assumptions made in NATO exercises. Sorties are typically far longer in war. Only 70% of the aircraft may be available. People get tired. Mistakes are made.\\\\n\\\\nSo where does that leave our brave new world of USS Ford (heavy), HMS Queen Elizabeth (medium), and USS America (light)? Particularly the latter as that\\\\u2019s what the question was asking about. Short of ordering up a war to try them all out (which I\\\\u2019m reliably informed would be unethical) we have to assume the exercise metric they claim is a pro rata indicator of what can be expected in war time. And none of the ships have even been tested yet to the exercise level.\\\\n\\\\nHow\\\\u2019s it going?\\\\n\\\\nThe USS Ford has been failing to get close to its sortie targets. Dr Gilmore, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, reported in 2013 that he\\\\u2019d be happy if he could make the Ford at least as good as a Nimitz.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n%3E It is unlikely that CVN-78 will achieve its Sortie Generation Rate (SGR) (number of aircraft sorties per day) requirement. The target threshold is based on unrealistic assumptions including fair weather and unlimited visibility, and that aircraft emergencies, failures of shipboard equipment, ship manoeuvers (e.g., to avoid land), and manning shortfalls will not affect flight operations. DOT&E plans to assess CVN-78 performance during IOT&E by comparing to the demonstrated performance of the Nimitz class carriers. A demonstrated SGR less than the requirement but equal to or greater than the performance of the Nimitz class could potentially be acceptable.\\\\nNotice how all the objections are real world, not so much exercise objections. As long as the exercises are like-for-like, Ford should still be able to exceed the Nimitz. If it can\\\\u2019t, something real has gone wrong, as the Nimitz has exactly these same issues to contend with.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s now more than 6 years later, and things still don\\\\u2019t look good. In March and April this year, USS Ford will undergo its first flight deck certification, and direct comparisons will be made against USS Bush\\\\u2019s 63 fixed-wing sorties per day in 2009. We\\\\u2019ll know more then.\\\\n\\\\nHMS Queen Elizabeth on the other hand is reportedly hitting its combat targets nicely. \\\\u201cExceeding expectations\\\\u201d is a phrase that\\\\u2019s being used. The F-35Bs aren\\\\u2019t always running 100%, and after the Westlant 19 work up, one F-35B was left on the carrier for an extra week until it could be sorted out. But that was no big deal. The main target Queen Elizabeth is failing on is manning. The original crew was expected to be 670 plus 800 aircrew. it\\\\u2019s turning out to be over 760 plus aircrew.\\\\n\\\\nCrew and equipment levels might be the Queen\\\\u2019s Achilles heel. If aircrew needs have also been underestimated that\\\\u2019s likely to be the sortie limiting factor. It may have enough going for it to reach 2.0 sorties per plane and possibly exceed it, but not with as many as 36 aircraft. The carrier could cope, but will there be enough trained aircrew?\\\\n\\\\nWe won\\\\u2019t know for a long time as the MoD is being slow to buy the F-35B. That\\\\u2019s understandable. The RAF and RN need the block 4 version to fit UK weapons such as the Meteor and the Spear 3. Any planes purchased now will need upgrading later, and the UK may have to live with equipment limitations on its first 48 planes for some time.\\\\n\\\\nThis year will see a squadron from each of the Royal Navy and the US Marines train together on HMS Queen Elizabeth. The USMC\\\\u2019s optimism could make an excellent match for the Royal Navy\\\\u2019s pragmatism. If the Marines bring some MV-22 Ospreys for in-flight refuelling (something the RN currently lacks) we might get some interesting and instructive statistics filtering their way into the press over the coming year.\\\\n\\\\nPerhaps USS America shouldn\\\\u2019t be held to the 2017 plans. Even by extending the working day, it may be unrealistic to expect sustained sortie rates to remain as high as advertised.\\\\n\\\\nUSS America has the space to run high-tempo F-35 operations, and an aircrew well motivated to make it work. Without the worry of a separate angled deck and with its MV-22s offloaded to a forward base, it\\\\u2019s possible USS America could give some great sortie rates initially. Her issue could be insufficient space on the ship and time in the schedule to maintain the planes properly.\\\\n\\\\nThe first wartime deployment of F-35B for the Marines off the USS Essex wasn\\\\u2019t intensive, with 100 sorties in 50 days spaced out over a six month deployment. But it will have taught the Marines something about the practicalities of flying F-35Bs in anger, and maybe which bits of the 42 sortie schedule is realistic and which not. It might be hard to translate from the Essex to the more capable America. In terms of size, what\\\\u2019s learned from operations in the even larger Queen Elizabeth could bracket that requirement nicely.\\\\n\\\\nBut neither experience will offer the operational intensity the USMC want from their ship at capacity. The only way to work out the consequences of high tempo is to try it. It\\\\u2019s hard to know when USS America will be ready to do that. She commissioned in 2014, three years before Ford and Elizabeth, and completed her first deployment two years ago, so you\\\\u2019d think the data would have already come out. However, in normal operations USS America only carries six F-35s. She\\\\u2019s been spotted with 13, but when she\\\\u2019ll get to try carrying and using 20 over an extended period hasn\\\\u2019t been announced.\\\\n\\\\nFor different reasons, each class, Ford, Elizabeth and America, will take years to get to the point where a direct comparison of sustained sorties can be made. Until then partial tests and indicators are all that will let us speculate on which service has backed the right horse.\\\\n\\\\nThe world may not be thinking about it, but you can bet your bottom dollar, when it comes to light carriers, at some point the Marines will be doing, not just considering.\", \"',\n",

For e.g., a Cochrane review initiated in 2011 (1) to compare data on efficacy of available methods hasn\\'t yet published its completed report. Head lice or Pediculosis humanus capitis are small insects that colonize human scalps, laying their eggs there and feeding on blood. While not life-threatening, their saliva can cause localized itching and damage, which in turn can facilitate secondary bacterial infections.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended Approaches And Rx For Head Lice\\\\n\\\\nMain Rx approaches are manual, oral or topical.\\\\n\\\\nIvermectin is the only available oral Rx (prescription only) and only available to children %3E5 years old and weighing %3E15 kilos.\\\\n\\\\nTopical Rx can be divided into chemical or physical pediculicides as well as herbal remedies. Many herbal remedies consist of essential plant oils. How they work isn\\'t fully understood yet but they aren\\'t very effective anyway (2 [ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deon_Canyon/publication/235419172_The_effect_of_natural_products_on_head_lice_In_vitro_tests_and_clinical_evidence/links/09e41511688468eb23000000.pdf ]).\\\\n\\\\nProblem is head lice are fast developing resistance to the older, common, ubiquitously available, over-the-counter topical (chemical) pediculicide Rx (3 [ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03806.x/epdf ]). Hence the increasing prevalence of resistant head lice, i.e., super lice.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the numerous over-the-counter choices and increasing lice resistance to many of them, choosing an Rx that efficiently gets rid of them has become a serious headache so much so that a decision tree is the optimal approach (see chart from 4 [ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psb.1077/pdf ] and suggestions from 5 below). Physical pediculicides are newer, safer, more effective options to older chemicals.\\\\n\\\\n * Re-infestation is best prevented by active contact tracing within household, play group, kindergarten and school.\\\\n * Synchronized Rx, i.e., Rx of all infested individuals at the same time, is the most optimal way to minimize recurrence. School-based control programs and mathematical modeling show this effectively interrupts transmission (6 [ http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPAR%2FPAR138_10%2FS0031182011001004a.pdf&code=8c05be2eda928aef7ed3eff3d6c22b2f ], 7 [ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0021848.PDF ]).\\\\n * Manual approaches include wet combing, the only technique sensitive enough to detect even sparse head lice. Also the only effective approach for those who wish to avoid using chemicals (4 [ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psb.1077/pdf ], 5).\\\\nChemical Insecticides (see table below from 4 [ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psb.1077/pdf ]).

Though %3E12 products are commercially available, few have been carefully examined using randomized clinical trials (5).\\\\n\\\\nAdvantages of physical head lice Rx\\\\n\\\\n * Clear, colorless, odorless and hydrophobic, dimeticones coat lice cuticles and enter their spiracles (breathing holes) to cause their suffocation, i.e., a purely physical mode of action (11 [ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035419.PDF ], 12). Similar mode of action is ascribed to 1,2-octanediol (10 [ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035419.PDF ]).\\\\n * Can kill eggs though efficacy depends on formulation (10 [ http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/asset?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035419.PDF ], 13, 14 [ http://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-015-0381-0 ]).\\\\n * Dimeticones have been used for years as defoaming agents in products ranging from detergents, toothpastes to cooking oil. Being biochemically inert, they\\'re considered non-toxic (14 [ http://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-015-0381-0 ], 15).\\\\n * Given how they cause lice to die, development of resistance is quite unlikely (16 [ http://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TODJ/TODJ-4-77.pdf ]).\\\\nPregnant and Breast-feeding mothers: Wet combing and dimeticone 4% most suitable (17 [ http://www.wmic.wales.nhs.uk/pdfs/bulletins/Head%20Lice%20Bulletin%20Jan%202014.pdf ]).

They have body colour similar to the surroundings they inhabit and this way they camouflage themselves. Thin body, clinging type claws with piercing and sucking type mouthparts that they possess are supportive to their parasitic activity.\\\\n\\\\nThese bugs develop through incomplete metamorphosis. Females lay eggs singly which hatch out in about a week. Like adults, the nymphs also feed on blood diet. The nymphs pass through 5 to 6 instars according to the species they belong. After this, they turn to adults and start reproducing.\\\\n\\\\nInfestation is through body contact, sharing clothing, comb and things alike. Clean living is the best way to avoid infestation.

You\\\\u2019d need to find each drywall screw with a little tilty magnet thing or some electronic \\\\u201cstud-finders\\\\u201d can do that (hopefully there are screws and not nails*), uncover it, use a razor knife to get the taping mud out of the philips head indent, unscrew it; wash, rinse, repeat. 32 to 38 times per sheet.\\\\n\\\\nYou probably want to keep track of where each sheet went, since they were cut and screwed for where the studs and electrical boxes were behind them.\\\\n\\\\nReinstalling them runs the risk of the new screws going past the paper surface, if you resuse the same screw locations. If that keeps happening, move the screw location an inch up the same stud. A screw only counts as holding the sheet to the wall and providing the mandated sheer strength if you DON\\\\u2019T punch through the paper, it should be to just barely below the surface of the paper.\\\\n\\\\nAnd, jeez, then there\\\\u2019s the tape that was applied over the joints. You\\\\u2019d have to remove that. You could cut it with a razor knife, but you need to get under it to remove those screws. It peels off easily enough but often takes the drywall paper surface with it. Without that intact paper on both sides, it\\\\u2019s not code-complaint drywall.

If you look closely at the grey toe rim of the shoe it literally says \\\\u201cfor outdoor use\\\\u201d.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\u201cextra durable\\\\u201d is important because most outdoor courts are made of asphalt and that surface wears down sneakers very quickly.\\\\n\\\\nSo look for shoes that feature the XD/XDR logo or say \\\\u201cfor outdoor use\\\\u201d.

Also, the average garden hose cannot supply enough water and water pressure with the detergent action to avoid damaging a vehicle\\\\u2019s finish. This important study concluded that automobile owners should avoid washing their vehicles at home. Only a professional car wash can provide the proper amounts of water and pressure needed along with the appropriate soaps and waxes to safely and effectively clean your vehicle. The International Carwash Association working through a special Carwash Research Foundation Grant to the University of Texas at Arlington, Texas, has conducted extensive car washing tests this past year to determine the effect on car finishes by comparing various car washing techniques ranging from professional car washing to the bucket and sponge used by many auto owners.\\\\n\\\\nHand car washing is extremely harmful to automobile finishes\\\\n\\\\nTests conducted by the University of Texas to compare surface disturbances showed that a single home hand wash on an automobile can produce scratches that penetrate as deep as 1/10 of the total thickness of the automobile\\\\u2019s paint. These test findings at the University of Texas substantiated tests done over ten years ago by the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in association with Mercedes-Benz, which at that time showed that similar damage was done to an automobile when using detergent, low water volume commonly found in hose nozzles at home, buckets of water, sponges and towels used in the average home car washing.\\\\n\\\\nSpecific scientific tests at the University of Texas further showed that hand car washing can produce so many marks on a car\\\\u2019s finish that they cannot even be counted. The tests showed that in all hand washing temperatures, surface reflectance readings steadily declined, with some hand washing techniques being considerably worse than others. By contrast, when cars were washed by professional full service car washes, there was virtually no change in the surface reflectance or shine readings. The tests showed that the average backyard hose is not able to supply enough water along with the detergent action to avoid damaging the car\\\\u2019s finish. The most harmful method of washing cars was found to be the special \\\\u201ccar wash\\\\u201d brushes that hook on to a garden hose and are purchased from local hardware stores or automotive supply dealers. The use of this type of brush with the low water pressure that comes out of the garden hose is the most destructive on the finish of an automobile. The tests also showed that techniques used at professional car washes are virtually harmless to automobile finishes. Findings from the University of Texas research study indicate that with the large amounts of water and specialized detergents used in professional car washes, sophisticated gloss and reflectance meter readings from new finishes used on automobiles were virtually the same before and after the equivalent of several months of normal washings in a professional car wash.\\\\n\\\\nThe best car wash for your car\\\\u2019s finish\\\\n\\\\nThe professional car wash is able to provide and use tremendous amounts of water along with specialized detergents and appropriate mechanical action from cloth pads and curtains which the backyard hose and bucket hand car wash is not able to supply. This important and interesting research study performed by the University of Texas found that today\\\\u2019s automobile owner is much wiser to have their car washed by a professional car wash, rather than washing it at home in their own backyard.\\\\n\\\\nTexas Results Substantiated by Munich Study\\\\n\\\\nThe Technical University of Munich has carried out an impartial scientific comparison test in association with Mercedes-Benz to establish the exact ranking of hand washing versus machine washing of vehicles relative to damage to paintwork. To make the test as realistic as possible, typical family sedans were used \\\\u2013 with a few hundred miles on the odometer. It was stipulated that each car was to receive the equivalent of one year\\\\u2019s wash stress (about 25 washes) \\\\u2013 some cars by hand washing methods, others by automatic car washing equipment.\\\\n\\\\nTo make the test as realistic as possible, and to give both the hand washers and the automatic car wash something to get clean, five test vehicles were thoroughly coated with a mixture of street dirt, under-fender dirt accumulations, oily water, and thawing-salt residue. This test mixture, inspected under a microscope, contained grit particles measuring between 0.5mm and 1.0mm which are enough to damage the toughest paintwork if not carefully removed.\\\\n\\\\nThe Hand Wash\\\\n\\\\nWithout having been told the why\\\\u2019s or the where fore\\\\u2019s, four men were given the chore of washing four of the test cars by hand. Each person was to do as thorough a job as possible. Since there were four people involved, and since each person used their favorite \\\\u201ctools\\\\u201d, together they presented a cross-section of various hand washing techniques commonly used by average car owners.\\\\n\\\\nSo the marathon carwash began. The four men showed up in four different sections of town enthusiastically sponging and lathering their test cars as if they were their very own.\\\\n\\\\nBystanders could see one man hard at work in a do-it-yourself self-service type of car wash with high-pressure water facilities; another was busy at home with the garden hose and a water spray-brush. One man scrubbed away utilizing a bucket, a sponge, and a garden hose. One, to the horror of the environmentalists, and in defiance of local regulations, washed his test car at a lakeside.\\\\n\\\\nThe Automatic Car Wash\\\\n\\\\nAs the alternative to the perspiring hand washers, automatic car washing equipment was used to wash the fifth test car. To keep the test above board, the test vehicle arrived unannounced during the hours when the car wash was open for business. The car was washed along with other cars.\\\\n\\\\nThe Examination\\\\n\\\\nTo measure the extent of paintwork damage, microscopes were available. However, pure reflecting microscopy, as well as electron microscopy results merely in a visual picture of scratches. A comparable measure of true depth cannot thus be achieved. Consequently, a method of analysis was used which could determine the exact depth of the scratches and grooves, namely, the interference-microscopic analysis method. This method allows the glossy surface, with all of its irregularities to appear like a relief map. An interference band is created and corresponds to the contours. Band distances are 0.27 of one thousandth of a millimeter, thereby allowing even the tiniest grooves and scratches on the gloss to be accurately measured and compared.\\\\n\\\\nThe Result\\\\n\\\\nThe comparison tests produced results of which every car owner should be aware. Automatic car washing and hand washing have completely different effects on automobile paint. How does the paintwork of a car appear after 25 washes \\\\u2013 equivalent of a year\\\\u2019s worth of washing? The results are depressing, at least to the car owner who, up to now, has firmly believed in hand washing. The deepest scratches after hand washing had a depth of more than one tenth of the paint surface. Under the microscope, the paintwork looked like a cratered landscape. The paintwork was deeply scored and scratched \\\\u2013 the result of dirt and trapped sand particles In hand washing, invariably too little water is used. Even with a garden hose and a sponge technique, small sand particles lodge themselves firmly in the fine pores of the sponge or wash mitt and cannot be removed even by good rinsing. Such particles work on the paint surface like sanding discs. Furthermore, the hand washings produced a tangle of uneven scratches in the paint surface.\\\\n\\\\nBy comparison, the surfaces of the test vehicle washed with automatic car washing equipment appeared different. Compared with the hand washed surfaces, it was remarkably smooth, with many very fine markings virtually parallel and uniform \\\\u2013 less than .0003mm \\\\u2013 the result of evenly moving and rotating cloth pads and curtains. The machine-washed surfaces were in very good condition after 25 washes. Wash a car by hand or by machine, in either case, it looks immaculate right after the wash. The sophisticated test described suggests that looks are deceiving: the paintwork on a car washed by automatic car washing equipment is in much better condition than one washed by hand \\\\u2013 even though the car owner lavishes tender, loving care on their vehicle. Eventually, either by force of habit or because the car finish looks dull, the weekend hand washer resorts to the lengthy and back-breaking chore of applying abrasive rubbing compound or similar pastes and liquids to their vehicle. This process indeed restores the luster to the finish. Such \\\\u201cpampered\\\\u201d cars naturally appear to have just rolled out of the showroom. The proud motorist forgets the long hours with the rubbing compound, and is probably unaware that the reason for all that work (to get the scratches out) was their energetic hand washing procedure on previous weekends. On the other hand, the motorist who uses the services of a professional car wash with their automatic car washing equipment subjects the paintwork of their vehicle to the thorough, but gentle action of cloth pads and curtains which treat their paint job with tender, loving care. Knowing that the car finish has to have some protection against the ravages of the chemicals in the air and to also provide a barrier of protection against bird droppings and other contaminants, this car owner will periodically apply a coat of wax to their vehicle. At that moment, their car looks as if it had just rolled out of the showroom. In comparison, although both cars after washing and other treatment will look pretty much the same, a car is actually treated better (especially concerning the paint finish) by machine washing at a professional car wash and the application of wax than a car washed by hand (with the resulting need for the application of rubbing compounds, etc.). However, in the process, the car owner who utilized the services of a professional car wash has saved a great deal of time, labor, and effort.\", \"',\n",

The full-time dishwasher preferred to keep working the \\\\u201cintake\\\\u201d end of the machine, so I just waited at the other end to put the clean dishes away. Mind you, this is a high-capacity, conveyor machine designed to handle the volume of dishes that go along with serving banquets for hundreds of people all at once. It has a capacity of six full racks moving through it at once. (One rack, loaded properly, holds 14 dinner plates.) Think something like this, but longer and custom-designed for our space:\\\\n\\\\nJackson AJ-86 Dual Tank High Temperature Conveyor Dishmachine with Gas Tank Heater - Right to Left, 230V, 3 Phase [ https://www.webstaurantstore.com/jackson-aj-86-dual-tank-high-temperature-conveyor-dishmachine-with-gas-tank-heater-right-to-left-230v-3-phase/490AJ86GRLR.html ]\\\\n\\\\nThe guy loading the machine was driving me nuts because he would load the plates into a rack, then grab the sprayer hanging above. He would spray. And spray. And spray and spray and spray and spray and spray until every plate in the rack was absolutely spotless before he would finally push the rack into the machine. Then he\\\\u2019d start loading the next rack.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, I would be at the other end of the machine, waiting for that first rack to emerge. It takes approximately one minute for a rack to progress from one end of the machine to the other. When it came out, I would unload the plates, stack them, and put them away. Then I would walk to the opposite side of the kitchen, push the elevator button, wait for it to arrive, and ride it down to the lower floor, whereupon I would walk outside to my car and smoke a cigarette (don\\\\u2019t smoke, kids). I would then lock up my car, go back inside, ride the elevator back up to the kitchen, and meander back to the dish pit just in time to unload the second rack of plates. That\\\\u2019s how much time he was spending spraying.\\\\n\\\\nIt was so unnecessary. This dish machine doesn\\\\u2019t have those spindly, whirling arms with jets on them. It has massive, stationary, high-pressure, high-volume jets that blast the dishes with so much water under so much pressure that, if the top jets get clogged enough to lower the volume and pressure from above too much, the jets below will actually launch the dishes right out of the rack. It has a set of these firehoses in the first, \\\\u201cscrapping\\\\u201d section of the machine, which just blast the dishes with plain hot water to remove all of the loose debris. Then the rack proceeds to the \\\\u201cwash\\\\u201d section, which has the same jets, but with soap this time. Finally, the rack passes through the \\\\u201crinse\\\\u201d section, where the dishes get 30 seconds or so of lower-pressure, scalding-hot water to sterilize them.\\\\n\\\\nOne night, I decided I\\\\u2019d had enough of that nonsense. The dinner dishes came back - about 400 plates. The regular dish guy decided to eat first before he got started, so he helped himself to some food (in a convention facility, staff meals come from whatever is left over after the guests are finished) and went to the back room to eat it.\\\\n\\\\nAha! Now\\\\u2019s my chance! As soon as he was out of sight, I stepped up to the loading station and went to work.\\\\n\\\\nThe other guy looked a little bit surprised when he returned and discovered that, in the time it took him to eat his dinner, I had gotten all 400 dinner plates through the machine and put away, and had made a significant dent in the other dishes.\\\\n\\\\nAnd yeah, they were spotless.\", \"',\n",

A couple of years ago we spotted a clean 2008 Mercedes at a private party car lot and took it for a ride. The guy selling had some company detail it before hand. On the test ride, pretty soon the car was billowing out smoke from the engine department. We had the salesman with us and immediately pulled over and pulled the hood release. We soon learned the detail company had really spray cleaned the engine dept with water and when we got back from the test ride, there was still evidence of water. Have no idea what they did, but we refused to buy the car, even thou the owner called and said all was good.

Not really a recipe for reliability. But as some of the other answers stated, the engine is designed to run up to the redline. The engine wears faster when it spins faster, but not on some exponential scale. If that were really a problem, the manufacturer has every ability to stop you from doing it.\", \"',\n",

       "   3: ': \"Overhead is relatively low so pricing is largely based on labor costs. Now, there are several basic types of cleaning services out there. Some companies operate on a independent contractor basis which means that the actual cleaner who shows up to do the work may or may not be able to give you the best cleaning for the higher than some price you\\'ll pay. Some companies give the independent contractor employees decent training but it\\'s more likely they only give \\\\u201cdo\\\\u2019s and dont\\\\u2019s\\\\u201d training because the pay is based on an hourly pay but the company is not making a cut of the job if the employee is not actually cleaning a house. The independent contractor status is mostly beneficial to the company and not the employees so quality of service varies widely depending on skill, experience, work ethics and stamina of the person or perhaps 2 person team who shows up and cleans.\\\\n\\\\nOther companies who do not hire people as independent contractors are more consistent with the quality of service because the company does a bit more training. It\\'s also likely that a \\\\u201clead\\\\u201d member on the team who comes to clean is responsible for both quality control and guidance for the group. Consistent quality but probably not exceptional and be prepared for 3 to 5 person teams with a lot of changes to the persons who will show up every cleaning. These companies tend to charge at the highest end of the spectrum because they offer fair pay compared to independent contractor companies, they train new employees and they also have higher overhead in providing a company vehicle, cleaning equipment and supplies, as well as some of them offering employee benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBoth of the above described types of cleaning companies do have some type of a guarantee/insurance/bond in case of sub-par cleaning, negligence, damage or theft. This is figured into the price and obviously the better the guarantee offered for those things, the higher the cost to the customer.\\\\n\\\\nThe other most common type of cleaning company is the \\\\u201clittle guy\\\\u201d which varies from completely under the radar cash for cleaning individuals to a small business that is licensed and operating legitimately as such. The cost of services in this group can vary greatly but will be less than the cost of one of the \\\\u201cbig guys\\\\u201d because there are lots of fingers in the big guys pies! I personally operate as a legitimate small business that provides residential cleaning services. I\\'m not charging minimum wage prices but I\\'m also well below the cost of the big guys. I might have reason to be biased as my opinion comes from the position of being a small business owner but the little guys who keep it legit such as having a business license and a clear price structure based on the exact services that will be performed will usually keep their cleaning services personal, meaning quality control is the best it gets in the business.\\\\n\\\\nThe method I used when I first started out, and worked by myself, for determining what to charge is that I took minimum wage and added $5 an hour to it. I provided all necessary supplies to do the job and got myself there so that $5 an hour over minimum wage was to cover those costs and because I felt I worked harder than minimum wage and cared more than minimum wage. Fast forward 18 years to now and I have changed my pricing structure but not by as much as you might think! Now I have employees so obviously I need to charge per hour at least what they are paid (and it\\'s higher than minimum wage to start plus raises regularly based on performance and dedication/longevity)per hour plus my minimum wage plus now $7 an hour for myself but I now also include a $25 per job fee that goes directly to me because I provide exceptional service in every way and I do so every house, every time! I have 18 years experience and I am better at my job than ever before and my company name remains unblemished because of the great care and pride I take in providing excellent cleaning and customer service. I don\\'t give that pricing breakdown when quoting or billing for my services but that is my method for determining it. I keep up with what other companies are charging, both big and small, so I can tell you that my pricing remains lower, usually significantly so, than the big guys and higher than the non licensed individuals who often charge little more than minimum wage.\\\\n\\\\nOne final note on how I determine what to charge. I sometimes have a customer that is unable to do the necessary basic cleaning upkeep in their home because of physical limitations and at the same time, they struggle with affording my services, especially on a routine schedule, let alone the prices of a bigger company. Although I have no official policy or fee schedule that applies in this scenario, I do offer those in obvious need a lower price \\\\u201cfor scheduling my services on a routine basis and not just once or occasionally\\\\u201d. That price is based on my employees hourly pay x 2. That\\'s it. We both make a bit more than minimum wage and the customer can live in a house that is at least clean enough to no longer be sub standard living conditions and often it\\'s cleaner than they ever had hope of living in! I am not a doctor who does miracles of healing or a lawyer who saves people from financial ruin, prison sentences or their vengeful exes and I do clean toilets to provide a roof and life\\'s basics BUT I can do one thing exceptionally well, I can clean, even the most hopeless of messes. So I think that sometimes my talent for cleaning should be used for good without much concern for profit.\\\\n\\\\nHappy cleaning!\", \"',\n",

Personally, I don\\'t like washing them with Olive oil, it seems wrong to me. I wash mine with dish detergent. All you do is put about a pea size amount I your palm(it will lather up.. A LOT), run the brush under water just enough to get it damp... Make sure to run it under water with the bristle side facing down so water doesn\\'t get in the barrel because that can break up the adhesive holding the brush together and essentially destroy your brush. Then just swirl your brush in the soap I your palm until you get a good lather going then just keep swirling and rubbing at it until you stop seeing product coming out of the bristles.

       "   8: ': \"I suspect you\\\\u2019re going to get many different answers to this, because everyone has their favorite way/products.\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I want to use the least expensive/most effective product/process possible. Isee no reason to spend $$$ on special \\\\u201cbrush cleaners\\\\u201d when their are inexpensive household products that work just as well - and sometimes even use,better than - products sold specifically for the purpose.\\\\n\\\\nFirst of all, we need to distinguish between natural hair brushes and synthetic hair brushes - as it\\\\u2019s better to use different products for each.\\\\n\\\\nIn general, natural hair brushes work best to apply powder products, such as pressed powder eyeshadows, blushes, etc., while synthetic hair brushes are best for applying liquid/cream products.\\\\n\\\\nThis is because each strand of natural hair is covered by overlapping \\\\u201cscales\\\\u201d called the cuticle. These \\\\u201cscales\\\\u201d pick up and transport powder products from the pan to the face more effectively than synthetic hairs (which are smooth).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, natural hairs absorb liquid and cream products -making them less effective for applying those types of products (foundations, primers, etc) than synthetic brushes.\\\\n\\\\nAny brush used to apply liquid/cream products must be thoroughly cleaned after each use. When applying liquid/cream products to your face, you\\\\u2019re picking up bacteria from your skin. Bacteria LOVES a damp, dark place to grow - and the interior of the brush head is just that. So, that\\\\u2019s why you must be very careful to clean (and sterilize) any brush you use to apply any \\\\u201cwet\\\\u201d products (or risk breakouts from redepositing bacteria on your skin the next time you use that dirty brush).\\\\n\\\\nThankfully, there\\\\u2019s a very easy - and cheap - way to clean those brushes. But, this can only be used on brushes made of synthetic hair (you shouldn\\\\u2019t use anything to clean a natural hair brush you wouldn\\\\u2019t use to wash your own hair). You simply pour about 1/2\\\\u2033 of 91% isopropyl alcohol (a.k.a. \\\\u201crubbing alcohol\\\\u201d or \\\\u201csurgical spirit\\\\u201d) into a clean glass jar, swish the brush head around for a minute, squeeze out the product from the brush, and either hang the brush head down (best) or lay it on a clean towel to dry. (It\\\\u2019s best to hang it, if possible, to prevent any moisture from seeping into the ferrule - the metal piece that covers where the brush head is glued to the handle - which can, over time, cause the glue to break down and the brush to shed).\\\\n\\\\nAs an F.Y.I. - isopropyl alcohol is generally sold in three strengths - 50%, 70%, and 91%. Only the 91% is strong enough to completely break down all the makeup clinging to the brush and sterilize it.\\\\n\\\\nNow, to clean your natural hair brushes (which you\\\\u2019re using to apply powder products only)\\\\u2026.\\\\n\\\\nSimply wipe the brush on a clean cotton towel after each use. Then, once a week, wash your natural hair brushes using baby shampoo and warm water. Be careful when washing your brushes to hold the brush with the brush head down (you don\\\\u2019t want any water to get into the ferrule), and then either hang them vertically (brush head down), or lay them on a clean towel, until dry.\\\\n\\\\nVoila! Clean brushes using inexpensive, easy-to-find household products!\\\\n\\\\nIf you do succumb to buying a special brush cleaner, test its efficacy by taking one of the synthetic brushes you used to apply a cream or liquid, clean the brush using the brush cleaner, and let dry. Then swirl it around in some 91% isopropyl alcohol. If the brush cleaner was effective, then there shouldn\\\\u2019t be any product left in the brush and the alcohol should remain clear\\\\u2026\", \"',\n",

Maple or Beech wood boards have a small amount of self-healing capacity, ensuring that the surface does not get heavily scratched. There are still more cuts and scratches on wood boards that bamboo.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a double edged sword however. Bamboo is much harder on the knife edge as it puts up much more resistance. This can dull knives quickly, and bamboo boards often have problems with cracking (if not properly oiled). The most common are cracks along the length of the grain between the dark and light wood. \\\\n\\\\nSanitation\\\\nFor food that gives off juices (meats and the like) bamboo (and plastic) boards are often the preferred method.

Bamboo has become the cutting board of choice with trendy patrons. \\\\n\\\\nOverall\\\\nI would usually choose a nice Maple or Beech cutting board for most applications, and a plastic (or maybe bamboo) for meats.

We already know hard stuff glass, ice, ceramic, steel, rock, and even the hardest woods like lignum vitae are unkind to knife edges.\\\\n\\\\nBamboo also doesn\\\\u2019t grow in such large pieces you can get a one-piece board made of bamboo. To make the boards, several pieces need to be bonded together. Some manufacturers use a glue or adhesive that hardens up to a high hardness. Again, cutting hard things is bad for knife edges.\\\\n\\\\nA manufacturer who knows what they are doing will minimize the amount of bamboo nodes included in the board and will use an adhesive that doesn\\\\u2019t dry excessively hard. This kind of bamboo board is definitely worth using and will be as good as your classic maple board.\\\\n\\\\nA manufacturer who doesn\\\\u2019t care or who doesn\\\\u2019t know what they are doing will include a lot of nodes and use a hard-drying adhesive.

       " {'What-s-an-easier-and-funnier-way-to-clean-your-room\\n-UNANSWERED': {1: ': \"Does it matter to you how clean your house is when someone comes over?\\\\n\\\\nI was told a long time ago that we don\\\\u2019t see the world as it is, we see the world as we are. I didn\\\\u2019t understand what it meant for a long time, but now I do. It is really hard not to assume that people aren\\\\u2019t judging me on the cleanliness of my living space when I know that I do it to them.\\\\n\\\\nYes, I know how obnoxious that is, but hear me out. I was raised by a narcissist with no education and no job who had nothing better to do all day than to clean the house. The house was not always spotless, mind you, but she will insist that it was. She bragged that I was a good housekeeper and she didn\\\\u2019t need to do anything now that I was old enough to do it all for her, even though she had nothing else to do and I was in school. She had this whole idea of how things were supposed to be and I was her only daughter, and we live in the South (U.S.), and of course, it was my job as a woman to keep my house clean. And if I don\\\\u2019t have a clean house, regardless of the pets, regardless of the kids, regardless of my husband, regardless of my full-time job, it is my fault. She made sure to constantly get that point across well into my adulthood. My brothers only had to do the outside chores. I had to do the inside and outside chores.\\\\n\\\\nMy upbringing, especially regarding cleaning the house, involved a lot of Catholic-level guilt. While I obviously understand that this isn\\\\u2019t healthy and I am extremely busy and not the only person who lives in my house and is responsible for the mess in it, there is a disconnect between my intellectual understanding of things and the way I was raised to think. It probably doesn\\\\u2019t help that my husband is a slob and his mother was a lot like mine about cleaning\\\\u2026 possibly worse, really, because you could actually eat off her floor.\\\\n\\\\nAll of this has led to a few things about my behaviors and personality and preferences that are kind of obsessive and over the top. For example, I make my bed every weekday and it kills me not to do it on the weekends but my husband would need to be out of the bed for that to happen. I don\\\\u2019t like him to help me with it because he does it wrong. If it isn\\\\u2019t perfectly like I want it, it stresses me out. And of course, he\\\\u2019s just going to get back in it when we\\\\u2019re done, which also stresses me out. I have a morning routine and if anyone helps me with it, it throws me off. I spent nearly two years with my foster daughter helping me out and me not saying anything but having it drive me insane. I actively don\\\\u2019t like having anyone but my daughter and her friends visit the house. That isn\\\\u2019t to say we never have company, but after 13 years, if my husband has learned anything, it\\\\u2019s to let me know if he\\\\u2019s expecting someone to come over because the house needs to be clean (and I think he only learned that one because it was what he grew up with). But even if no one is coming over, I want the house clean because having things where they belong helps my anxiety levels. And when I say where they belong, I mean that I have specific places on my bookshelves for each book and I don\\\\u2019t want him to move it. I have specific places for everything, really, and I hate when someone doesn\\\\u2019t put things back where I want them. He doesn\\\\u2019t really care about my need to have things orderly in a specific way.\\\\n\\\\nI do not do everything, though, because I have an autoimmune disease with all the myriad symptoms that go with that and I just don\\\\u2019t have the energy to do it all. So my husband does his own laundry and is supposed to keep his side of the bedroom clean. He doesn\\\\u2019t keep it clean and has to be reminded often, but I won\\\\u2019t do it. And I realize that people could come over and judge me for what his side of the room looks like (mainly his nightstand), but I have to accept that judgment is not a reflection of me and my skills as a Southern woman, but a reflection of the person judging me and their antiquated ideas about who is responsible for the housework, even though they all know I work and it is obviously a mess I didn\\\\u2019t create. My side of the bed is clean.\\\\n\\\\nAnd just to punctuate how stressful it is for me to have my house a mess in the event someone comes over, I have actually stopped writing this answer to get up, empty the dishwasher, reload it, make the bed, and sweep up the mess my crazy cat made around the litter box. I haven\\\\u2019t cleaned the house this week, in fact, and I don\\\\u2019t want to clean around my husband. I will probably clean today, including sweeping and mopping. Not that anyone is coming over, but I\\\\u2019ll be happy that it\\\\u2019s clean if someone does show up.\", \"',\n",
       "   2: ': \"Where should you start when you\\\\u2019re cleaning a house you\\\\u2019ve really let go? Is it the dirtiest room, the cleanest room, or another room?\\\\n\\\\nI think you should pick one room and just focus on that. If you think about the rest of the house, you could easily get overwhelmed. A lot of the time, that\\\\u2019s what happens in hoarder houses. The hoarder is a collector and a perfectionist and for a lot of people who are perfectionists, they get overwhelmed with the idea of it and don\\\\u2019t know where to start or how to get it perfect. There is no perfect and so they just don\\\\u2019t do it. So just start with one room and only focus on that. Give yourself a day to do it. Or two if necessary\\\\u2026 or whatever you need, but only focus on that one room.\\\\n\\\\nSo now you want to know which room that should be. I don\\\\u2019t like working with shoulds. More often than not in this situation (and really most situations), there are no shoulds. Shoulds can make us feel bad about ourselves because we think we aren\\\\u2019t living up to something. So no shoulds.\\\\n\\\\nWhat would I do? Well, I would start with the kitchen. It\\\\u2019s the room where the food lives and I want to be able to cook in a room that\\\\u2019s clean and isn\\\\u2019t contaminating my food. So that\\\\u2019s the room I start with. However, while you are working on the kitchen, you can do other things that are automated and don\\\\u2019t necessarily live in a specific room. Like the laundry. A lot of times, when you let your house go, you\\\\u2019ve got laundry everywhere that needs to be done and if you just pick all of that up and get it washing, your house will already look instantly cleaner without a lot of effort. I mean, you\\\\u2019re just going around the house, grabbing dirty laundry, bringing it to the laundry area of the house, sorting it, and throwing it in the washer. While it\\\\u2019s washing, you can be cleaning the kitchen (or the room you choose). And then when the washer stops, you can take a short break to move that to load to the dryer and then add another load to the washer. And when that load is finished, you can sit down for a bit while you fold the clean laundry.\\\\n\\\\nThe second room I would work on would be the bathroom. Because bathrooms are small areas that can get really gross really quickly. From there, I would probably do rooms that other people are going to see if they come over, like the living room. But you may feel differently. Maybe the chaos of the house makes it hard for you to sleep and so cleaning the bedroom would make more sense. The point really is to just get started. I think a lot of motivation, for me, comes from getting one room done. I will often tell myself that I am limited to one room when I know that I have a lot to do because I let things go. I do this because I know that doing more than one room causes me physical pain because of my health issues. But once a room is clean, I\\\\u2019ll often feel motivated to immediately clean another room. Especially if I didn\\\\u2019t overdo things in the first room.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"Some tips for cleaning from cleaning services [ https://luxurycleaningny.com ]:\\\\n\\\\n * Always, when you have a mess in the room, and scattered clothes, the first thing to do is remove your clothes.\\\\n * When you need to change in a hurry, be sure to fold the removed clothes right after changing clothes. Yes, immediately after changing clothes. If you do not, then things will accumulate and they will be hard to remove.\\\\n * Make a list of melodies on your iPod and call it \\\\\"room cleaning\\\\\". Choose your favorite songs that make you want to sing and dance. And the time spent cleaning will pass much faster.\\\\n * Buy boxes or something similar and sign them, indicating what lies in them (toys, books, games and etc.).\\\\n * Set goals, for example, once a week to clean the object (s), such as a table, drawer, bedside table, etc. And set a goal - keep it clean for a whole week.\\\\n * Be prepared for certain situations that can undermine your even the most powerful efforts. If you went on a trip or you had a hard day, then you can feel tired (simply) and just throw your things on the floor. This is the worst thing you can do. It is very important to disassemble them immediately. Later you will be grateful for this.\\\\n * If you still can not keep the room clean, even using these tips, perhaps your organization of things needs to be improved. Sometimes changing the order of organization and storage of things can work miracles.\\\\n * Also, the fewer things in your room, the easier it is to keep it clean.\\\\n * Do not leave garbage in your room, for example, on the floor, bed, table, etc. If you find garbage in your room, then keep a trash can in it to quickly clean up. If you have any documents or important notes from the school, try to keep them in a pile, and not scattered around the table. Also, try not to throw dirty napkins on the floor or put them back in a box of napkins, because - it\\'s just disgusting.\\\\n * Sometimes, if you are bored, imagine that you are a prisoner in a dungeon, and if you do not clean the room in time, then the evil custodian of the dungeon (your mom) will come and find out that you did not. And if you finish on time, then you will be rewarded with a successful escape! For young girls and guys, this game can be fun. Remember that you can also have fun, imagining that your basket for dirty laundry is a basketball net, and your clothes are balls. But remember, if you miss, you will still have to pick up clothes.\\\\n * Always clean the room before you go to school, so you will have a habit of keeping cleanliness in your room.\\\\n * Try to clean the room every day and put the trash can in the room.\\\\n * Avoid letting people into the room, especially if they have never been there before. They will consider your things, pick them up and not put them back in place.\\\\n * Keep a photo nearby with a picture of how your unmade room looked before. If you feel the urge not to put things in their place or disturb the room, look at the photo and you will see what happens if you do not make efforts.\\\\n * Download the audiobook on your mp3 player and put his pocket at the time of cleaning. If you need to read this book as a homework, then listen to it while cleaning, and you can do a few things together.\\\\n * If you do not live in the room yourself, talk to the person with whom you live, if mostly the disorder comes from him.\\\\n * Try to keep your laundry basket empty. Wipe your dirty things every 2-3 days. Just regularly wash things and it will become a habit.\\\\n\", \"',\n",

Start filling the washer drum with water. Because I have the same fear of the holes as you, (even though I know this fear totally disregards fact), I usually let the drum get a good inch or so of water in the bottom before moving to step two.\\\\n2. Fill your detergent cap with the amount of detergent needed.. (Now this next step is where I really get buck wild..)\\\\n3. Rather than pour the detergent into the drum, hold the cap under the water stream that is pouring into the drum.

Lysol and other detergent based cleansers do not kill (or destroy if you don\\\\u2019t think viruses are alive) certain types of viruses that are unenveloped.

However, even if you were trying to kill something you know the cleanser should work on , you don\\\\u2019t get 100% kill. And this is why using soap and water to clean your hands is so important. Germs are often stuck to other materials like bits off food or dirt or other random debris. That debris protects them from the disinfectant. Also microscopic air pockets and surface tension can prevent the disinfectant from wetting all the surfaces. Washing with copious amounts of water with soap helps loosen and remove germs even if it doesn\\\\u2019t actually kill them. As a final thought bleach or hypochlorite and other oxidizers are more effective at killing even spores and viruses.

There are no health hazards associated with water hardness, however, hard water causes scale, as well as the reduced lathering of soaps. Hard water should be not used for washing (it reduces effectiveness of detergents) nor in water heaters and kitchen appliances like coffee makers (that can be destroyed by scale). It is also not good for fish tanks. In general, there are many applications where ability to easily determine water hardness is very important.\\\\n\\\\nComplexometric titration is one of the best ways of measuring total water hardness. At pH around 10 EDTA easily reacts with both calcium and magnesium in the same molar ratio (1:1). Stability constant of calcium complex is a little bit higher, so calcium reacts first, magnesium later. Thus, for the end point, we should use the same indicator we use when titrating magnesium - that is Eriochrome Black T. In the case of water that doesn\\'t contain magnesium at all, to be able to detect end point we should add small amount of magnesium complex MgEDTA\\\\n\\\\n2+.\\\\n\\\\nMagnesium will be displaced by identical amount of calcium, and it will be titrated later, not changing final result. However, this is a very rare situation.\\\\n\\\\nIf solutions contains carbonates, they should be removed as they can interfere with end point detection.

Now, the most common salt that people are familiar with is table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl)\\\\u2026 which we put on so many of our foods. NaCl in water forms the ions Na(+) and Cl(-).

So, there is a reason right there to use \\\\u201cde-ionized\\\\u201d (deionized) water \\\\u2014 to get rid of things (like NaCl) that might make water taste bad.\\\\n\\\\nNot all salts are as \\\\u2018harmless\\\\u2019 as NaCl, though. Some salts release ions that take part in destroying things (like metals, proteins, DNA\\\\u2026 you name it!).

However, this process also \\\\u2018destroys\\\\u2019 most things\\\\u2026 we just don\\\\u2019t call it \\\\u201crusting\\\\u201d when it happens to food and other stuff.\\\\n\\\\nOkay, that said \\\\u2014 we don\\\\u2019t want things that have to come into contact with water to be destroyed, be they car engines, foods, medicines, and so on.

Other businesses pay a percentage of the overall cost of the cleaning. So if you are commissioned 33% of the overall cost, say $100 clean, then you made $33 for your work (which you could then average out over how long it took you to do the job to get the hourly rate you made).

Obviously, if you live in an area where cost of living is low, wages are average, and people don\\\\u2019t have a lot of extra money sitting around, you\\\\u2019ll want to charge on the lower end of this range -and people will pay that amount! If you live in an area where cost of living is average, wages are above average, and people have money sitting around, then you\\\\u2019ll want to charge about mid-range ($30\\\\u2013$40/hr).\\\\n\\\\nYou have considerations though:\\\\n\\\\n1.

Why?\\\\n\\\\nThe problem in Europe and also in North America, not mentioning other countries is old plumbing system that can\\'t even handle 3 ply toilet paper or paper products made from bamboo. So in perfect conditions many wipes marketed as flushable are safe to flush, but we are not living in the perfect world. Add low water pressure, oils, greases or other chemicals into the mix and we have a major problem. Right now even best flushable wipes block the pipes, stopping other things behind them for few hours, creating blockages, then dissolve but obstruction which makes movement or flow difficult or even impossible is already made. It took us years to convince wastewater companies to investigate the standards what is flushable in perfect conditions and what is flushable in real life.\\\\n\\\\nThere is tremendous difference: being flushable and if it actually should be flushed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ufeffCurrently, there are two differing standards on what can be flushed. The standard set out by Water UK (the representative of the water companies who have to deal with stuff that actually ends up in our sewerage systems!). The second standard, often used to inform product labelling in the UK, is the EDANA Standard, which is designed by the product manufacturers themselves. We liken this to a drinks manufacturer setting safe drinking limits. The water companies are very clearly and loudly saying this standard does not comply with the Water Industry standards. The water companies have come together in an unprecedented step to present an international water industry position statement on non flushable and \\\\u201cflushable\\\\u201d labelled products, supported by 15 Countries and over 200 organisations. The statement makes clear what should and should not be disposed of via a toilet, and supports the view that wet wipes and or similar products should only be marketed with prominent and clear \\\\u2018do not flush / bin it\\\\u2019 labelling. For any product to be labelled or considered flushable it would have to pass the water industry test requirements, and the product should not contain plastic or regenerated cellulose - to ensure it is truly biodegradable and not causing more microplastics or other non-biodegradable materials to enter the oceans.\\\\n\\\\nIf the word \\\\u2019biodegradable\\\\u2019 is used on a packet or inferred, that doesn\\\\u2019t tell us how long it takes for the product to breakdown, nor if they are able to breakdown in all environments e.g. freshwater vs. saltwater.

       "   2: ': \"You can\\\\u2019t stop your skin from aging, but to make it show its age less and to lessen the effects of age, there are many good options. In my facial plastic surgery practice, I spend a LOT of time talking about skin care with my patients, as many of them have the same concern you posed in your question.\\\\n\\\\n1. Protect your skin from the sun. It doesn\\\\u2019t matter what skin type you have, just protect it with high SPF (40+) and reapply it after 2 hours if you\\\\u2019re in the sun.\\\\n2. Use whatever face washes, moisturizers, and non-medicated products you want. There are several good options to choose from, and I would not spend a lot of money on these despite what everybody on this site and Instagram is trying to sell you.\\\\n3. Use a Vitamin A derivative. This means retinol, and tretinoin (Retin-A). Retinol is available over the counter in its weaker forms, but the prescription strength Retin-A is much much better, and there are a couple of products (Renova and Refissa) that are formulated with an emollient or moisturizer to balance the drying effect that these products have on your face. Don\\\\u2019t skimp on this product. Get a good one and use it regularly after the \\\\u201cbreak in\\\\u201d period of getting your skin used to it. I tell my patients to start out with once weekly use for 2 weeks, then twice weekly use for 2 weeks, then every other day use after that. If you can use it more often, then that\\\\u2019s great. Some people can\\\\u2019t do this because they get peeling. Either way, if you\\\\u2019re worrying about skin aging, then this is the holy grail product.\\\\n4. Use a Vitamin C serum on your face. This is applied right after you wash your face in the morning, and there are several good products to choose from. SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic is \\\\u201cthe best\\\\u201d, because they have done scientific studies against their competitors and have shown superior results based on clinical studies.\\\\n5. To treat or prevent age spots, sun spots, or pigment changes, a 4% hydroquinone product works very well. In fact, it is the gold standard skin lightener. The Obagi Nu Derm system uses this, as do many other products. It is not available everywhere, and it is a prescription product in the USA, so you need to get it prescribed or buy it from a doctor\\\\u2019s office. Weaker strengths of hydroquinone can be found in over the counter products, but do not work very well.\\\\n6. Microneedling treatments can help stimulate collagen in the dermis, giving your skin a \\\\u201cvibrant\\\\u201d look and feel. It thickens the skin, because collagen attracts water, and by thickening your skin, the fine lines and wrinkles are reduced.\\\\n7. Laser Resurfacing procedures treat both the deeper skin to stimulate collagen production, and the superficial skin to even out skin tones. They are best done in combination with a medical grade skin care regimen, and can have dramatic results. My laser patients are some of the happiest patients in my practice. I have experience with fractional erbium laser resurfacing, as well as fractional CO2 laser resurfacing. Both can give great results when delivered by experienced hands, and can \\\\u201cturn the clock back\\\\u201d unlike any other treatment. To get the most out of it, pre-treat your skin with a Retin-A, 4% hydroquinone, and vitamin C serum, and resume this after treatment. It\\\\u2019s the \\\\u201cmagical\\\\u201d 1\\\\u20132 punch that whips your skin into shape.\\\\n8. IPL Photofacials can reduce the pink coloration that some people can develop over time. Rosacea can be a difficult problem to solve, and IPL is a great solution that treats this with zero to minimal downtime. They also have the added benefit of treating sun spots, or age spots, and have a modest effect on collagen production to improve skin texture. This is the best option for people that cannot tolerate the down time from a laser procedure or a medium depth chemical peel, though often times multiple treatments are required.\\\\n9. Chemical peels work very well by disrupting the skin surface cells and replacing them with younger, more vibrant skin. Superficial peels to keep your skin looking great are for maintenance. To treat the skin, then a medium to deep chemical peel can deliver much better results, though there is a down time associated with the healing. The deeper the peel, the longer the downtime, and the better the result is. There is no cheating this equation.\\\\nI know the list is long, but I wanted to make sure that the information was good and accurate. I try to mention brands as little as possible, as there are many good brands and products. For medical grade products, go to a doctor and make sure you are getting prescription strength. There is a false idea that the \\\\u201chalf strength\\\\u201d that you can buy over the counter is \\\\u201chalf as good\\\\u201d as the prescription strength product. I have not found this to be the case. Though it\\\\u2019s better than nothing, many times it just isn\\\\u2019t strong enough to deliver the results that you can get from proper prescription strength products, which often times end up being cheaper than the stuff everyone is trying to sell you on Instagram.\\\\n\\\\nNatural solutions are great when they work (in cases like vitamin C serum), but I don\\\\u2019t spend too much time trying to be \\\\u201cnatural\\\\u201d with my recommendations when people come to see me for results. I focus on products that work, and leave the non-medicated stuff (the \\\\u201cfeel good\\\\u201d moisturizers and toners) to my patients.\\\\n\\\\nCheck out some results from laser resurfacing combined with optimal skin care below:\\\\n\\\\n\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \"Hiya,\\\\n\\\\nThank you so much for your question.\\\\n\\\\nIt is my opinion, as someone with 20+ years of blonde highlights, that color treated shampoos do not make any significant difference.\\\\n\\\\nTo be honest, I used to think color shampoo [ http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip000724.htm ] made a difference, but over the years, I\\\\u2019ve changed my mind.\\\\n\\\\nImage of Model With Blonde Color + Highlights - Courtesy of HairBoutique.com [ http://Hairboutique.com ] - All Rights Reserved\\\\n\\\\nIf anything, I think they can be just as harmful at leeching color out of the hair as regular shampoo formulas.\\\\n\\\\nBeware Of Volumizing Shampoo Formulas\\\\n\\\\nIt should be noted that shampoo formulas designed to add volume to the hair may even cause colored hair to fade faster.\\\\n\\\\nWhy? Volume enhancing shampoo blows open the cuticle of the hair to encourage fullness. Unfortunately opening the cuticle allows the color to be more easily removed from the hair.\\\\n\\\\nColor Shampoos Will Help Balance Brassiness\\\\n\\\\nThe only time color treated shampoo will make a difference is if your goal is to add back some color or balance brassiness. Blue colored shampoo will help to even out brassiness for blondes.\\\\n\\\\nARTec used to make a great color shampoo which could be used to enhance previously colored hair and it was really fabulous.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately ARTec was bought by L\\\\u2019Oreal some years ago and the ARTec color shampoo (Sunflower was a favorite of mine) were discontinued.\\\\n\\\\nProtect All Hair - Colored Or Otherwise By Diluting\\\\n\\\\nActually, I don\\\\u2019t think any full strength shampoo for any type of hair - colored or not - is fine.\\\\n\\\\nWhich I why I always recommend diluting full strength shampoo formulas in a clean quart or larger sized jug.\\\\n\\\\nPersonally, because I have hip length hair, I use 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of shampoo designed to help hydrate dry hair, mixed with lukewarm water.\\\\n\\\\nI shake the shampoo up to make sure it forms a foam before drizzling it over the top of my very wet hair.\\\\n\\\\nOther Tricks For Extending Color Without Color Shampoo\\\\n\\\\nBesides using a diluted shampoo formula on very wet hair, I always do the following things to help keep my highlighted hair looking fresh and healthy:\\\\n\\\\n1. Only wet wash hair 1\\\\u20132 times a week.\\\\n2. Use a diluted formula with shampoo designed to hydrate and smooth.\\\\n3. Dry wash 1\\\\u20132 times a week to remove dirt, debris, oil or similar.\\\\n4. Use lukewarm hair only for wet washing.\\\\n5. Always do a final cool/cold water rinse to close the cuticles.\\\\n6. Avoid using hot dryers or styling tools (irons, curlers) which will fade color.\\\\n7. Stay out of the sun which also fades precious hair color.\\\\n8. Apply jojoba or other light oils to the ends which will keep hair soft but not impact color.\\\\n9. Always use leave-in conditioners and thermal protection products IF and WHEN my hair has to be heat styled for any particular reason.\\\\nNot All Color Shampoos Are Marketing Hype\\\\u2026.But\\\\u2026\\\\u2026\\\\n\\\\nHair color companies are in the business of selling products to clients who highlight or color their hair.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m not saying all hair color companies only care about selling their customers products, but color shampoo was initially invented to help promote various manufacturer\\\\u2019s color lines. Not specifically to extend the life of hair color.\\\\n\\\\nAsk yourself this question. If you were the manufacturer of a line of hair color products, would you want to help your customers extend the life of their color so they didn\\\\u2019t need to buy more color or return faster to the salon?\\\\n\\\\nThat speaks volumes.\\\\n\\\\nYes, in all fairness, there are some hair manufacturers who may make color formula extending shampoo to help extend color life.\\\\n\\\\nDo all hair color companies? Only you can decide for yourself.\\\\n\\\\nFollow Whatever Path Is Best For You & Your Hair Color Maintenance\\\\n\\\\nFor me, I don\\\\u2019t think you need to use a special, and usually more expensive, shampoo formula to extend and/or protect your hair color.\\\\n\\\\nIf you follow the steps I\\\\u2019ve listed above to protect and maintain your color, dilute your regular shampoo designed for your hair type and texture, you should do great.\\\\n\\\\nOf course if your hair colorist has strongly recommend a color extending shampoo to you, then maybe there is a good reason.

I never told this to anyone until a couple months ago my boyfriend found out. He got shocked! I also promise you that you don\\\\u2019t need to be shocked for not using shampoo because it is not gross or unhealthy or anything else.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I ask people how my hair smells they mostly say it doesn\\\\u2019t smell or it smells slightly nice because I am using pure coconut oil after my shower. When I was in India I and my friends started using coconut oil for everything (they also put it on their beard and it smelled very nice even being around them). It smells amazing and also it is really healthy for everything!\\\\n\\\\nWhen it comes to softness, I never had that problem as my hair is curly and most of the time dry as shit, but I learned later that even if your hair gets oily when not using shampoo, if you stay patient, your hair will get used to it and stop being wild.

I don\\\\u2019t wash my hair with water and coconut oil together (Lots of people understood it wrongly I guess). I wouldn\\\\u2019t recommend that. I put jusssst a little bit of coconut oil, like a bit less than my toe nail. It is just to give one\\'s hair a slightly nice smell. It is not supposed to clean your hair. So if your hair is sticky and oily because of that you might consider other ways or try to put less coconut oil.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the fact that I am only washing my hair with water is an actual fact. If you don\\\\u2019t believe it because you tried it and you didn\\\\u2019t get the same results as I did, it is not because of me lying. Everybody has different type of hair and I am not a beauty expert so maybe you should try something else.

If your hair is normal, that might not work either.\\\\n\\\\nLet me tell you the purpose of washing yourself and shampooing: It\\'s not just about the hair itself. It is also very important to cleanse the skin and scalp (which is skin on your head). Your skin is the largest organ of your body. Yes, that\\'s right an organ\\\\u2026just like a lung or a pancreas. Except it\\'s outside instead of inside. Your skin has pores which are tiny open windows to the inside of your body. That\\'s why you can put topical creams and ointments (chemicals natural and synthetic) and they work. They get into your system and work for you\\\\u2026.just like food, fluids and medication. That is health-care 101.\\\\n\\\\nYou wash your hair to get the grease, sebum from your pores, products you use, dirt, pollution, and anything else OFF YOUR SKIN AND SCALP AND HAIR THAT TRAPS DIRT, GRIME, GREASE, DANDRUFF, SEBUM AND ANYTHING ELSE ON THERE. Your skin needs to breathe so that it is healthy. Let me say that again. Your skin needs to breathe to be healthy. That\\'s why your wash, lather up, rinse well and keep clean. You want all of your skin and scalp to be clean. Your mother didn\\'t teach you to wash and shower to piss you off. There is a valid scientific reason that has been proven over and over again. You all love scientific reasons. There you go.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you keep your scalp clean and your skin clean, you\\'re healthier by a huge margin. Your skin is a huge protector that prevents really bad things from getting into you and making you sick. When you get a wound of any kind, the first thing you should do is to COVER it with something as clean as possible preferably sterile. Most people don\\'t carry sterile equipment with them\\\\u2026so you use the best and cleanest you can find until the skin clears up and closes up. You get to the doctor as soon as possible or bandage it up very well yourself so the SKIN heals up.\\\\n\\\\nWashing the body anywhere is about keeping your skin clean and intact to prevent bad \\\\u201cthings\\\\u201d from crossing that barrier and making you sick immediately or eventually.\\\\n\\\\nBy doing so with shampoo, it makes your hair healthy. It allows the nutrients, healthy oils, etc come through.\", \"',\n",
       "   5: ': \"Shampoos are for cleaning the scalp of excess oils and sweat, dirt, styling products, etc. If you shampoo your hair every day, you can expect to lose more hair and cause it to break and make more split ends. You should shampoo only 3 times a week, at the most, and brush (Not comb) from the scalp to the ends every night. (the traditional \\\\u201c100 strokes\\\\u201d is not necessary, but give it a good brushing). This distributes the healthy oils down the hair shaft and removes the excess hair that you lose every day. For most healthy people, this is between 50\\\\u2013100 hairs daily. Your own scalp\\\\u2019s oils will make your hair strong. Get a good cut, or trim, or whatever you want to call it, to keep your ends from splitting. If you wear your hair long, expect to cut at least 2\\\\u2033 every 6 months. If short, 1/4\\\\u2033 every month, in order to keep your style in shape and to get rid of split ends.\\\\n\\\\nAside from these daily grooming tips that you should do, stay away from shampoos that are mostly water and wax and lots of other fillers (alcohol, sulphates, etc.) Spend a bit more on a good professional shampoo, bought in a salon, and you can use less product but get more uses because you don\\\\u2019t have to use a handful of shampoo to get your hair clean. And, use a conditioner on the hair, not the scalp, then comb from the ends upwards to remove tangles. If you have fine hair, you really can\\\\u2019t change your texture but you can take better care of the hair you have. If you have coarse hair, the nightly brushing is the best thing you can do to improve your shine and control the density.

While these products may remove some stains, they may also exacerbate the problem.\\\\n\\\\nBrowning is a common occurrence. Your carpet dries from the bottom up, so after your cleaning attempt, organic material left behind at the bottom may travel up to the surface to wave an ugly \\\\u201cHello\\\\u201d at you (we call this \\\\u201cwicking\\\\u201d), turning the carpet brown. Even when browning does not occur, the soaps and shampoos may create a tar pit, trapping every dinosaur (or particles of dirt) that happens by. Over an all too short period of time, these particles build up and give the appearance that the original stain has come back from the dead \\\\u2013 it may even look worse than it did before!\\\\n\\\\nInstead of using store-bought carpet cleaners, go to your medicine cabinet and grab that brown bottle of Hydrogen Peroxide from inside. You\\\\u2019ve probably been using this for cuts and scrapes all of your life, just like Mom did, but that\\\\u2019s a bad idea. Peroxide will kill good bacteria as well as bad. It can be put to better use as a cleaner and mild bleaching agent.\\\\n\\\\nTake a spray nozzle (they\\\\u2019re mostly universal) and screw it right on the top of the brown bottle. Mist enough peroxide on top of the spot to get it moist, but avoid soaking it. Use your fingers to brush it in. It will take about eight hours to get the full effect, so go on with your life and come back to the spot later. If it hasn\\\\u2019t worked well enough for you, try it again. You won\\\\u2019t hurt anything. The best reason for treating your carpet stains with Hydrogen Peroxide is that it won\\\\u2019t leave any residues behind. It comes in those brown bottles to keep it from turning into oxygen or water, and that\\\\u2019s exactly what it\\\\u2019ll do over the course of those eight hours.

Household hydrogen peroxide (or H2O2) is diluted about 98%, and the stuff we use professionally is much stronger and also quite safe for most carpets, which are essentially made of plastic. The chemical works through oxidation, by blasting the stain with oxygen. It won\\\\u2019t permanently remove colors like the chlorine bleach you use for your whites when doing laundry. The exception to this rule is natural fibers such as wool; don\\\\u2019t use it on natural fiber carpets.\\\\n\\\\nWhile hydrogen peroxide is super handy to have around, it is not the be-all-end-all magical bullet of DIY carpet cleaning.

Then use a q-tip to clean one stand of carpet with the acetone. See if the acetone removes the color from the carpet. If the carpet is OK, then you are in luck. Take some absorbent paper towel sheets and place one behind the carpet strands you want to clean, so they are kind of pushed or folded onto the paper towel with your finder. While you have them pushed onto the paper towel (its protecting the rest of the carpet), use the q-tip to put some nail polish remover on them and lightly run the q-tip over the affected carpet strands. If you see the nail polish color coming off onto the q-tip, then get a new q-tip. Keep doing this until you get as much of the color out as you can. Keep your finger on the affected strands so they are still pushed up against the paper towel.

Rubber trees must be allowed to grow for about seven years before they become viable for harvesting rubber. Once the trees have reached the appropriate level of maturity, they will be tapped. Tapping generally occurs every two to three days, but never more often than once per day. The tapping process involves stripping away a small section of bark at a slight angle to facilitate latex drainage. The same area of the tree can be tapped repeatedly. When a particular area of the tree is tapped out, a new portion of the tree will be tapped. It generally takes seven years for a tapped area to heal sufficiently to be tapped again. A tree will normally produce about half a cup of latex per day. Once the latex has been collected, it will be mixed with a diluted acid. The rubber/acid mixture is then rolled twice. The first rolling is to remove excess water. The second rolling is to texture the rubber. The rubber is dried and can then be sold or exported.\\\\n\\\\nSynthetic Rubber Production\\\\n\\\\nSynthetic rubber production begins with the refining of oil, coal or other hydrocarbons. During the refining process, naphtha is produced. The naphtha is collected and can then be combined with natural gas to produce monomers such as styrene and isoprene, which are necessary for the production of synthetic rubber. The monomers are then generally subjected to either an emulsion polymerization process or a solution polymerization process. In both cases, the idea is to create chains of polymers which results in a latex or rubber substance. These substances can then be processed into useful rubber products using techniques such as vulcanization, which is used to produce rubber for tires.\", \"',\n",

The psychological pay-off is addictive in the same way as gambling: there is a variable interval reinforcement schedule, because you don\\'t know whether there will be a new message waiting for you there or not, or whether it will be interesting or not:\\\\n\\\\nhttp://mindhacks.com/2006/09/19/why-email-is-addictive-and-what-to-do-about-it/\\\\n\\\\nSo, to maximize your productivity, you should try to handle email in blocks of time. It\\'s OK to check between longer tasks, but don\\'t let email interrupt your longer tasks -- don\\'t check your email to procrastinate! When you check, you should process everything that is actionable, and then you should leave your inbox alone for at least an hour or more, depending on the other tasks you need to accomplish. Checking your email 2-3 times a day is usually sufficient, unless you have urgent SLAs. To boost productivity, you may want to avoid checking your email first thing in the morning:\\\\n\\\\nhttp://sidsavara.com/personal-development/do-not-check-email-in-the-morning\\\\n\\\\nIn between your email checking times, you can still set alerts to make sure you don\\'t miss business-critical messages. There are a variety of tools to let you do this. In Gmail, you can set desktop notifications in Chrome for important messages only; on your Android, you can have Gmail push a sound alert when you receive mail matching particular criteria (like from your boss).

You can buy their mail list and instantly gain access to their pool of customers. Furthermore, you can take over any existing accounts that the company may leave behind.\\\\n\\\\nAnother way to populate your B2B email marketing list through maximizing your website is through the use of an anonymous website identification tool like Visitor Queue [ https://www.visitorqueue.com/ ].

Some people clean their guns every time they shoot them. For something simple like a break-action single-shot shotgun, you could conceivably NEVER clean it and not notice a difference in how it functions.\\\\n\\\\nTwo things here though: you aren\\\\u2019t clear what you mean when you say the action is \\\\u201cstiff.\\\\u201d All semi-auto shotguns have pretty powerful recoil springs that would make their actions hard to work in any case compared to something like a .22 or a handgun. You also don\\\\u2019t say if this is a gas-operated shotgun, such as the Remington 1100, or a recoil-operated gun, such as the Browning Auto-5 or a Benelli. Gas-operated shotguns are quite a bit dirtier than recoil-operated types, and definitely need more cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nEither way, if this gun has been sitting around for years it needs to be stripped and cleaned with something to dissolve dried gunk on the moving parts, then lightly oiled. WD-40 has a mild solvent in it, so it would work for the cleaning. Don\\\\u2019t use it as lube, because it dries out faster than a lot of other stuff and leaves some residue when it dries. A gas-operated gun will also have small holes drilled into the barrel as gas ports, and these need to be checked to make sure they are clear.\\\\n\\\\nThe only number I\\\\u2019ve ever heard when it came to this subject is that a gas-operated gun should get a basic cleaning every 200 shots, which works out to eight boxes of shells.

Undetected leaks create mold, unclean vents are unhealthy too.\\\\n\\\\nAll things being equal (let\\\\u2019s assume you\\\\u2019ve checked all those other major conditions already), how do you get rid of the smell? Here are some simple, inexpensive, quick remedies I have tried that work:\\\\n\\\\n1. Baking Soda Baking soda is the mother of all odor absorbers for me. You can use it in your smelly shoes, brush your teeth with it to neutralize your bad breath but most importantly, sprinkle it on your carpet and rugs to rid of any foul smells. You don\\\\u2019t even need to vacuum it up right away. It costs about a dollar a box and one box is enough for one bedroom.\\\\n2. Distilled White Vinegar This is a great, maybe not so quick remedy to use especially with pet urine on carpets. Immediately pour it on top and dab it up with a cloth towel after 10\\\\u201315 minutes. Another way I have used it is in a carpet steam cleaner. Instead of soap, use 3 parts lukewarm water to 1 part Distilled White Vinegar and the smell should go away. A gallon of Distilled White Vinegar will cost you $2-$4.\\\\n3. Cut an Onion. I kid you not - this works too! Cut an onion, white, yellow, purple - it doesn\\\\u2019t matter. The bigger the better. Let it sit in a bowl in the same room for about an hour then remove it. For some reason, the room will neutralize and everything will come back to normal. One onion will cost you a dollar or two.\\\\n4. Mask It. If you\\\\u2019re in a pinch - just laid out a new rug and expecting company over in a few hours and don\\\\u2019t have time to do any of the above, mask the oder with Febreeze, a scented candle, PineSol or a plug in air fresheners. My favorite immediate choice is Pine Sol. Pour some directly on a wet sponge and rub it along the doors and entryways throughout the house. Not the whole door and entryway, just the space at nose level where your guests will walk by. I\\\\u2019m being totally serious, it will seem like you\\\\u2019ve been ckeaning all day and it only takes a few minutes. Your mom will be so proud! A bottle of PineSol will cost you about $5. Air Fresheners in every room is my least favorite and most expensive - some are $5-$10 per bottle.\\\\n5. Frozen Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Always keep a roll in the freezer. This is a great trick realtors use right before showing a home and it works too! I say frozen because you don\\\\u2019t need to spend time mixing anything. Just pop them in the oven - even just a dozen and the whole house will smell FANTASTIC! A roll of cookie dough costs $3-$5. It\\\\u2019s another way to mask the smell and will last overnight.\\\\n6. Almond Extract. Boil water with a few drops of Almond Extract in a small pot then just let it sit on the stove top while it cools off. You could also use a small crock pot and let it simmer all day too. This is another way to mask the smell when short on time. A bottle of Almond Extract will cost you about $4 but will last a while.\\\\nHope these ideas help. Let me know which ones you\\\\u2019ve tried? Thanks for the A2A! Good luck!\", \"',\n",

Therefore, it is critical to prevent a respiratory infection.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the main causes of respiratory infections is amonia buildup, resulting from the rats urine. Its very important to keep their cage clean and not allow such buildup. The more rats you have sharing a cage, the more often the cage must be cleaned, especially the surfaces and replacement of their bedding. With 2\\\\u20133 rats, generally a once a week cleaning should be fine, with one or two quick surface wipedowns in between. With more than 3 rats, cleaning is advised more often than weekly.\\\\n\\\\nThe type of bedding you use is critical. The bedding should be as dust free as possible. Be aware that those commercial beddings such as Carefresh that claim to be 99% dust free is stilll too dusty! You can see the dust when you shake it around in the sunlight. The best of that kind of bedding is the crinkled 100% paper bedding which ive found only on Amazon, not in pet stores. If you prefer wood shavings, Aspen is the only safe one. Pine and others cause respiratory issues. But Aspen is too dusty in my opinion. Never use fleece for cage floor liners! It collects and harbors urine odor terribly, though you can use fleece hammocks, just wash them often. Personally, I loved using puppy pads as cage floor liners. They are cheap, absorb odor pretty well, and are easy to replace.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as other odors, the rat area should be as free of scent as possible.

For example, ethanol is an effective virus-killer, against infections like herpes and the flu, and isopropyl is even more effective against bacteria.\\\\n\\\\nEthyl alcohols will kill viruses, funguses, and bacteria, but do not kill bacterial spores,\\\\\" says Johannes Wessolly, Medical Director of Miskawaan Health Group [ https://www.miskawaanhealth.com/about-us/ ]. \\\\\"Depending on the type of alcohol used, it can kill or render a wide variety of germs inactive.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHow to use alcohol to kill germs\\\\n\\\\nMost cleaning products, disinfecting wipes, and hand sanitizers contain enough alcohol to kill germs. For disinfection, alcohol solutions that have at least 70% alcohol, as well as most common EPA-registered household disinfectants, should be effective. Check the label to make sure before use.\\\\n\\\\nTo kill germs, the CDC recommends cleaning regularly touched items, like light switches, handles, and faucets, which can be done at home and in the workplace.\\\\n\\\\nGenerally, keep surfaces clean with a household disinfectant, specifically areas that are frequently touched such as doorknobs, phones, computer keyboard, and mouse.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, your phone likely carries more germs than a toilet seat, and it\\'s often overlooked when cleaning. Apple recently updated its phone-cleaning instructions, recommending \\\\\"a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes\\\\\" to wipe down the phone\\'s exterior, avoiding getting moisture in the openings.\\\\n\\\\nWhen disinfecting items with alcohol-based products, the CDC suggests following these steps, along with reading the instructions on the label:\\\\n\\\\n * Make sure the product is at least 70% alcohol.\\\\n * Ensure the area has good ventilation.\\\\n * Use gloves, preferably disposable ones.\\\\n * Wash hands with soap and water once gloves are removed.\\\\nWhile scrubbing surfaces with alcohol-based cleaners may help kill germs, washing your hands is still the best defense against viruses and bacteria.\\\\n\\\\nThere is no practical way to sterilize or sanitize everything we come in contact with, and no need to either.

Besides improving power output and overall efficiency, this also reduces emissions \\\\u2013 an efficient engine is cleaner. But, there is more to emissions reduction than fuel economy.\\\\n\\\\nThe evaporative emissions control system (EVAP) actively controls hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, what we call , raw fuel vapors. The charcoal canister is a big component of the EVAP system, working with various tubes, sensors, and valves to stop fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. In the presence of sunlight, HC emissions react with nitrogen oxides (NOx), forming ozone (O3). Ground-level ozoneirritates lungs and eyes and is a major component of smog. Such emissions have also been linked to various cancers. The EVAP system utilizes the canister to limit HC emissions during refueling. What is a charcoal canister? What does it do and why is it important? Finally, how do you replace it?These are key questions that will be treated in this article.\\\\n\\\\nWhat Is the Charcoal Canister?\\\\n\\\\nThe charcoal canister is a sealed container that is filled with \\\\u201cactivated carbon,\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cactivated charcoal.\\\\u201d Activated carbon is basically processed to give it an incredibly disproportionate surface area for its size; it\\\\u2019s a sponge for carefully absorbing fuel vapors.

(For a proper comparison, a dollar bill weighs roughly a gram and only has a surface area of 0.01 m2 or 0.11 ft2).\\\\n\\\\nTo stop HC emissions from escaping into the atmosphere, valves control air flow through the charcoal canister. While refueling, the canister vent valve opens, allowing air and fuel vapors to flow through the canister to the atmosphere. The activated carbon then strips the air of fuel vapors. After refueling, the canister vent valve closes, thus sealing the system.\\\\n\\\\nUnder certain operating conditions, such as low-load highway cruising, the ECM will push the canister purge and vent valves to open. As the engine pulls air through the charcoal canister, fuel vapors are flushed out, to be burned in the engine. Thus, harmful HC emissions are significantly reduced, replaced by harmless carbon dioxide and water (CO2 and H2O) vapor in the exhaust.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Do You Need to Replace the Charcoal Canister?\\\\n\\\\nThere are a couple of reasons you might need to replace the canister. The signs you may notice from a faulty charcoal canister might include check engine light (CEL), difficulty refueling, poor engine performance, excessive fuel odor, or the reduced fuel economy.\\\\n\\\\nCheck Engine Light \\\\u2013 A few DTCs (diagnostic trouble codes) may indicate canister replacement, usually EVAP leaks \\\\u2013 the ECM checks EVAP system integrity by running a pressure test \\\\u2013 or valve, pressure, or flow problems.

Many platforms such as soapfreeprocyon have begun to challenge this by producing eco-friendly cleaners that are soap-free and toxin-free, ensuring the best cleaning without the negatives.\\\\n\\\\nWhy Opt for Green and Clean Carpet Cleaning\\\\n\\\\nCarpets are one of the most used household items and face the wrath of dust, footsteps, spills, pet hair, and a hundred little things every day. When cleaning a carpet, people often focus on getting out all the grime and protecting the look of the carpet. However, choosing a green option is also very important. Here are a few reasons why -\\\\n\\\\n * It\\\\u2019s Always There\\\\nCarpets are more than just coverings - they are always in contact with a person, be it in the air they breathe, their feet, or when they drop down from the couch and sit on the floor. This means that toxins and irritants can always be transferred from the carpet to one\\\\u2019s skin and nose, which makes green carpet cleaning services [ https://soapfreeprocyon.com/ ] a much better option.\\\\n\\\\n * Carpet Stays Cleaner for Long\\\\nMost soap formulas tend to leave a sticky residue on the carpet. This means that dirt and particles stick to the carpet more easily, accumulating over time. A soap-free formulation not only prevents this, but it also helps in keeping the original look and color of the carpet for a longer time.\\\\n\\\\n * Odour Free\\\\nNatural cleansers are also odor-free. This means that the infamous \\\\u2018cleaning smell\\\\u2019 does not overpower the room, so there is no need to use copious amounts of air fresheners to get rid of the smell. Odour free also means that pets and kids are unlikely to be irritated by the smell of the green and clean carpet cleaning job.\\\\n\\\\n * Environmental Friendly\\\\nAs a consumer, it is the responsibility of every single individual to contribute positively to the fight against pollution and environmental degradation. Using green products is a great way to ensure that one does not add to the harmful toxins present on the planet, which are very damaging to humans, plants, and animals.\\\\n\\\\nThus, there are a lot of good reasons why one should opt for green carpet cleaning services.\\\\n\\\\nHow to Choose the Right Green Carpet Cleaner\\\\n\\\\nHere are some handy tips that can help in the selection of the right eco-friendly cleanser -\\\\n\\\\n * A truly eco-friendly cleanser should be soap-free, so it is important to ensure that the ingredient list does not contain items such as sodium Laureth sulfate, or other sodium products. If these are on the list, chances are that the product is not soap-free.\\\\n * A good cleanser should also be one that has undergone rigorous certifications to show its effectiveness as well as non-toxic nature. Any green carpet cleaning services that are not able to show these certifications are not worth using.\\\\n * Carpet cleaners also need to be hypoallergenic, meaning that they should not trigger the allergies of any person or animal. This is an essential requirement as any carpet washed with an allergy-inducing product would become virtually unusable.\\\\n * Last but not the least, the product should also be within budget. Today, there are a lot of options that provide eco-friendly green and clean carpet cleaning without burning a hole in one\\\\u2019s pocket, so there is no reason to pay for very expensive options.\\\\n\", \"',\n",

Cement grades determine the compression strength (mpa) of the concrete that will attain after 28 days of setting. There are about ten types of cement that is used for construction purpose. However, following are the five main types of cement which is widely used in house construction.\\\\n\\\\nOrdinary Portland Cement (OPC) 43 Grade Cement: It is used majorly for wall plastering works, Non-RCC structures, pathways etc. 43 grade cement attains an compression strength of 43 mpa (mega pascals) in 28 days of setting. Make sure that your 43 cement brand adheres to IS 12269 standard code.. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), 53 Grade Cement:\\\\n\\\\nOPC53 = It is mainly used in RCC and pre-stressed concrete of higher grades, cement grouts, instant plugging mortars etc. 53 Grade cement are used for fast paced construction were initial strength is to be achieved quickly. 53 Grade attains 27 mpa in 7days compared to 23 mpa by 43 grade cement. 53 Grade cement adheres to IS 8112 standard code.\\\\n\\\\nPortland Pozzolana Cement (PPC): PPC Cement has a higher degree of fineness, impermeable and corrosion-resistant quality that makes the concrete more dense resulting long lasting.its used in mass concreting work as well as RCC work. Even though the initial setting time of PPC cement is low, it gains more strength with time. PPC cement adheres to IS 1489 standard code.\\\\n\\\\nPortland Slag Cement (PSC):PSC is preferred over OPC grade in constructions where the structures are more liable to sulphate and chloride attack. Due to its excellent corrosion resistance, particularly from salt water, it is widely used in coastal regions, sewage disposal and water treatment plants. PSC Grade cement adheres to IS 455:1989 standard code.\\\\n\\\\nWhite Cement:This cement is used in architectural and decorative designs, it is also used to fill gaps in wall tiles, ceramic bathroom fixtures. The manufacturing process of white cement is different and more complicated when compared to ordinary portland cement.\\\\n\\\\nApart from the above, there are other types of cement which is also used in constructional purposes.\\\\n\\\\nSulphate Resisting Portland Cement (SRC)\\\\n\\\\nThis cement is used where the structure is more exposed to Sulphate attack due to water or soil. In SRC, amount of C3A is restricted to lower than 5% and 2C3A + C4AF lower than 25%. It can be used in sewage and water treatment plants. Dangerous in chloride existing environment.\\\\n\\\\nRapid Hardening Cement:\\\\n\\\\nIt is used in speedy construction and early completion is required due to lack of time or any other reasons. It is mainly used in repair and rehabilitation works.\\\\n\\\\nHydrophobic Portland Cement:\\\\n\\\\nIt is used in high rainfall areas to improve the shelf life of cement. The cement is given a chemical coating during the manufacturing process, that provides water-repelling property, and the cement is not affected due to high humidity and can also be stored for longer period.\\\\n\\\\nLow Heat Portland Cement:\\\\n\\\\nIt is mainly used in mass concrete for dams and many other types of water retaining structures, bridge abutments, massive retaining walls, piers, slabs etc.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\ude00\\\\ud83d\\\\udc77\\\\u200d\\\\u2642\", \"',\n",

       "   4: ': \"As a 10+ year vet of the construction industry, with 4 of that being spent as a foreman I can offer my perspective.\\\\n\\\\nYou cant be soft, at all. It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re a laborer, tradesman, foreman, supervisor, manager. There is no room for anyone being soft. Any sign of weakness and the fellas will exploit it. You need to be physically, and mentally strong in order to survive. If you show ANY kind of weakness. It doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re a good worker or not. You will be pegged as a whiner. As a result, you will never be able to fill a wheelbarrow fast enough. You will never work hard enough. You will be mocked relentlessly in order to weed you out.\\\\n\\\\nIt honestly, truly depends on what type of construction you are doing. It also depends on what type of leader you have working alongside you.\\\\n\\\\nAs a laborer, it is pretty much universal that you will be working very hard. It takes a special cut to survive as a laborer, and it is because of that that I grew to respect my laborers immensely. The reason I survived as a laborer is because I was able to eat untold buckets of sh*t. I did whatever I was told no matter how menial, or how hard the task was. Without reservations or complaints. You want me to shovel 5 yards of gravel out of the back of a 5 ton dump by hand? Sure where do you need it. You want me to carry buckets full of motor up a ladder to you on scaffolding? How much and how quickly do you need it? You need me to mark, and cut all these stones with precision? When does it need to be finished? You need me to haul wheelbarrows full of A gravel, up a hill, and level it to grade? No problem!!\\\\n\\\\nI did this because I figured everyone has to do their time. Everyone on the jobsite has worked hard and continues to do so. When a rookie comes in, they are given a harder time simply so they can prove themselves. When they do, the men back off and they earn themselves respect. It\\'s the rookies job to not let the team down.\\\\n\\\\nI graduated from laborer to lead hand because I was able to see the big picture. If I completed a task, I wouldnt ask what I needed to do next. I would begin prep on the next task of the job without stepping on anyone\\'s toes. I would never do someone\\'s job for them, I would get it ready for them to do their jobs. If the scaffolding was completed and the masons ready to go. I wouldnt ask, I would begin staging the stones for them in their work areas, than begin prepping the motor for them to use. The foreman would than come to me and tell me:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cI need you to start staging stones and get the motor ready\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cits already done boss, and the motor is in the mixer ready to go just need to add water. I didn\\'t mix it yet because I dont know if you guys are taking a break or not\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cwha\\\\u2026 well\\\\u2026 okay, nice job. Good stuff, take your break. Fire up the mixer when break is done. Good work\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI developed a reputation for being a worker who never needed to be told how to do anything. Just tell me what, and it will get done, properly, the first time, with no complaints.\\\\n\\\\nWith that being said, as a laborer I worked HARD. I would go to bed exhausted each and every night. But I loved that feeling as I felt like I earned the right.\\\\n\\\\nAs a leader, it was just as difficult as being a laborer. Just in different ways. Being a leader it was my job to ensure everyone had everything they needed to complete the jobs. Material, equipment, safety gear, trucks, even assigning the right laborer to the right task, with the right crew. I also had to know and understand the big picture, as well as plan/structure the job from start to finish.\\\\n\\\\nThe way I did this was to set up a timetable. Each crew had daily tasks to complete. I assigned the tasks to the crew leads respectively, than left them to do their jobs. I didn\\'t micro manage them. When their tasks were completed, and there was still work to be done. I would send them to help another crew as needed. At the end of the day we all went home at the same time.\\\\n\\\\nI was the first one on the jobsite, and the last to leave every day. At the beginning of the day I would take a look at what needs doing and make notes to assign crews according to the timetable. At the end of the day I would double check and triple check the work to ensure completion to code.\\\\n\\\\nDuring the day, I was still in the trenches working alongside the guys. That includes labor duties to cover for laborers that called in sick or quit (which happened frequently)\\\\n\\\\nAt the end of the day, especially on fridays. I would have wheelbarrows full of ice and drinks for the fellas. You need to reward good work, and encourage it.\\\\n\\\\nSo from laborer to foreman, I worked hard no matter what I was doing. The one thing absolutely no one wants to see on ANY jobsite. Is someone just standing around. ESPECIALLY from the leaders. If the laborers aren\\'t pulling their weight, the tradesman will have to pick up the slack, and that will not only tick them off but slow things down immensely.\\\\n\\\\nIf a leader just lazes around and expects everything to get done. The workers will resent that, and feel like they know better and begin to do things at their own pace which will slow things down. A crew is only as good as its leader. How effectively a crew works is a reflection of their leadership\", \"',\n",

As my studies included earth systems analysis I became alarmed at the pollution and carbon build up that the petrochemical industry was engaged in so I began to study alternative fuels.  During the summers I would install solar systems and wind turbines to gain practical knowledge (and make a little beer money.)  This was in the \\'70\\'s.  Of course, when gasoline prices began to fall due to cartel weaseling the alternative fuel industries suffered.  Reagan became governor then president and the tax credits were slashed.  As those industries collapsed I went back to school to get a degree in architecture.  During the summers there was very little interest in the solar industry since it was being maligned by the powers that were then running the show.  When I got out of graduate school the construction industry was in recession again but I stayed in contact with the portion of the industry that \\\\\"recycled\\\\\" old homes, (remodeled them so they kept their historical aspect.)  This was the 80\\'s and 90\\'s. As the price of crude crept up the alt fuel industries began to show new life and I was able to specify, if not solar panels, then at least energy efficient equipment and passive solar design.  In California, before the bubble burst, we were able to install a lot of solar systems and passive solar aspects to all of our designs.  After the bubble burst we starved and did work we hadn\\'t done for decades: install electrical panels, excavations for deepened footings, wood shake roofs.

You can get it right by accident, or have it wrong and never quite understand why. TQM for soaps is complicated, so I\\\\u2019ll tell you something important that no one selling you something will tell you: The soap has to be fit for purpose and user. People have different skin types and use soap in different ways. People also use soap where the water supply changes various characteristics of the soap, like lathering. One person can get by with a certain kind of soap that works really well for them, and their friend might think it\\\\u2019s garbage. What becomes important is consistency. The soap needs to be made in such a way that a customer can buy the same bar every week and know how it works with their skin.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, something no one ever talks about: The Blend.

You can use all the high-quality ingredients in soap you like, and still generate a crappy bar because you don\\\\u2019t know what you\\\\u2019re doing. Most customers won\\\\u2019t notice either, because most people don\\\\u2019t actually have skin that\\\\u2019s all that sensitive at the end of the day, anyway.

Most customers don\\\\u2019t know the difference. What you really want out of a soap is the right ratio of extra fat, glycerine, scents, and different species of fatty acid salts.

When emulsification has occurred, the soap is poured into molds. Colorants and scents can be added before pouring. The soap then needs a few days for the ph level to come down and for saponification to be complete, as it is extremely alkaline after mixing. Curing time is about six weeks after that. The soap hardens, and curing helps it to last longer when used.\\\\n\\\\nIn hot process soap, the oils are heated usually to a higher temperature, and after the lye water has been added and emulsification has happened, the batter continues to cook until it passes through several stages. Those stages ensure complete saponification before the soap is poured into molds. There are various things you can do to keep the batter fluid before it is poured, but cold process soap usually allows for a more fluid batter that is easier to make nice looking designs in. Hot process tends to look more rustic than cold process, although there are soapmakers that create beautiful soaps with the hot process method. HP soap can be used right away, but does benefit from curing for several weeks.\\\\n\\\\nAn advantage to HP is that you can choose the superfat. Superfat is the oil that is left over after all the lye has bonded with the oils in saponification. You want at least a few percent superfat in your soap. In cold process, there is no way to choose which of your oils ends up unsaponified, and will end up on your skin after use. With HP, you cook the soap til it is done, then add your desired superfat.\\\\n\\\\nI like avocado oil, olive oil, almond or apricot kernel oils.

This will tolerate colon characters in the values; that\\\\u2019s accomplished by adding the optional numeric argument to the .split() string method in my decoding loop.\\\\n\\\\nHowever I would not recommend this as the best approach for serializing your dictionary into a file. There are far better options depending on how you want to use the data later. The Obvious top choices are:\\\\n\\\\n * JSON\\\\n * Pickle\\\\n * dbm (anydbm)\\\\n * YAML\\\\n * SQLite3\\\\nJSON is the most portable among these. If you write/serialize your data in JSON format you\\\\u2019ll easily be able to read and update it from any modern programming or scripting language. For Python that code can be as easy as:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import json\\\\nwith open(mydatafile, \\'w\\') as f:\\\\n    json.dump(a, f)\\\\n[/code]\\\\u2026 where a is the name of your dictionary.\\\\n\\\\nReading back the data is as simple:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import json\\\\nwith open(mydatafile) as f:\\\\n    a = json.load(f)\\\\n[/code]In addition to not constraining your keys (allowing them to contain colon characters) this also allows you to have arbitrarily nested collections \\\\u2026 dictionaries of dictionaries or lists, lists of dictionaries or other lists, and so on; and it allows you to have values of types other than just strings. The json module [ https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html ] has been part of the standard library since 2.6 and there\\\\u2019s an optional python-cjson 1.1.0 [ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-cjson ] module which is written in C and compiled into a native binary module (.so or \\\\u201cshared object\\\\u201d on Linux and many other forms of Unix, .dynlib on MacOS X or .DLL on MS Windows). That native compiled module can be a couple hundred times faster than the version that\\\\u2019s included with Python which is implemented as interpreted (and byte compiled) Python source.\\\\n\\\\n(Update from 5 Dec 2019: there are also multiple options for high performance JSON handling in Python: Choosing a faster JSON library for Python [ https://pythonspeed.com/articles/faster-json-library/ ]).\\\\n\\\\nThe Python pickle [ https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html ] module has been in the standard libraries since 2.3 (which is, approximately, forever, in Internet years). The portions of the Pickle API for the purposes at hand are nearly identical to those I\\\\u2019ve described for JSON. That\\\\u2019s because the JSON and YAML modules for Python implement their equivalent functions (load, dump, loads and dumps) with the same names and parameter prototypes.\\\\n\\\\nSo any of these three serialization formats can be used with very little change to your code.\\\\n\\\\nUsing Pickle you\\\\u2019d have no interoperability with other programming languages. Pickle is only used for serialization to (and deserialization from) other Python programs/processes.\\\\n\\\\nThe Pickle format might be marginally more efficient than JSON. However the biggest difference, in semantics, would only become apparent if you\\\\u2019re using data other than strings as keys. In Python the keys 1 and \\\\u201c1\\\\u201d are distinct.\\\\n\\\\nIn JavaScript, Perl, awk, and a number of other programming and scripting languages the keys to a \\\\u201cdictionary\\\\u201d or \\\\u201chash\\\\u201d or \\\\u201chashmap\\\\u201d are evaluated (as \\\\u201cscalars\\\\u201d) before the lookup operations. Thus the number 1 (or 1.0) and the string \\\\u201c1\\\\u201d map to the same entry in those other languages while being distinct items in a Python dictionary JSON was based on the \\\\u201cJavaScript Serial Object Notation\\\\u201d \\\\u2014- essentially a subset of JavaScript\\\\u2019s literal source code syntax) \\\\u2014- so the JSON module implements JavaScript compatible semantics for interoperability.\\\\n\\\\nYAML support is not currently included in the Python standard libraries. It\\\\u2019s freely available as a third party module; the most well-known such version is: PyYAML [ http://pyyaml.org/ ].\\\\n\\\\nAs noted above, the way you\\\\u2019d use PyYAML is practically identical to the .load() and .dump() method calls we\\\\u2019ve seen for Pickle and JSON.\\\\n\\\\nThe other two options are for cases where you might want to have low latency random access to the data without necessarily having to load the entire file. DBM files are not simple text. They are stored in an indexed/sorted manner for efficient random access of data base on their keys (strings).\\\\n\\\\nThe code for using the anydbm  [ https://docs.python.org/2/library/anydbm.html ]module looks like this:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import anydbm\\\\nmydbm = anydbm.open(myfilename, \\'c\\') # or \\'n\\' to force a new file\\\\nfor k,v in a.items():\\\\n    mydbm[k] = v\\\\nmydbm.close()\\\\n[/code]\\\\u2026 and for access the data later:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import anydbm\\\\ndata = anydbm.open(myfilename, \\'w\\') # or \\'r\\' for read-only access\\\\n\\\\n# Now we access our \\\\\"data\\\\\" almost like we would with a dictionary:\\\\n# ... \\\\nvalue = data[somekey]\\\\n# ... use the value or whatever\\\\ndata[somekey] = new_value\\\\n# automatically written out to the file on .sync() or .close()\\\\n\\\\n# iterate over all the data:\\\\nfor key in data.keys():\\\\n    print(\\'%s: %s\\' % (key, data[key]))\\\\n[/code]Note that the anydbm module doesn\\\\u2019t implement all the methods that you see in Python\\\\u2019s dictionary type. Notably you don\\\\u2019t have .items() and .update() for example. If you select a specific dbm module you may get more extensive features. The anydbm module is there to facilitate a simplest common denominator for your code \\\\u2026 so it can be portable to any Python installation. Various versions and platforms might have any number of dbm modules enabled. The files generated by these various dbm modules are not all compatible with one another. (For Python 2.x there\\\\u2019s a whichdb [ https://docs.python.org/2/library/whichdb.html ] to help detect which DBM module created a given file and, thus, should be used to open and work with it; in Python3 that function is built into the dbm [ https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/dbm.html ] module).\\\\n\\\\nIn general the \\\\u201cdbm\\\\u201d handling in Python is useful when you have potentially very large collections of simple key/value data which you might want to efficiently access and update. However, it has a number of limitations with regards to more complex data, access patterns other than through the key, and concurrent (write) access from multiple processes.\\\\n\\\\nThus we also have the sqlite3 [ https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html ] module. This is an interface to the SQLite3 library/subsystem. It allows you to access local \\\\u201cflat\\\\u201d files through abstraction layers which behave like an SQL RDBMS (but without the separate SQL server). This includes the ability to have complex tables, foreign and composite keys, triggers, multiple index (including composite indexes) and so on.\\\\n\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s totally overkill for simple key/value data sets. However, if you were going to be using various complex queries, sorting, and aggregate functions on the data \\\\u2026 then writing it as a simple two column table in SQLite might actually make sense.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s what a very simple SQLite approach to your problem might look like:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import sqlite3\\\\ndb = sqlite3.connect(somefilename)\\\\ncur = db.execute(\\'CREATE TABLE keyvals (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)\\')\\\\ndb.commit()\\\\ncur.executemany(\\'INSERT INTO keyvals VALUES (?, ?)\\', a.items())\\\\n# cur.rowcount can be used to confirm the number of inserted items\\\\ndb.commit()\\\\n[/code]Once that database has been created it could be accessed with code like:\\\\n\\\\n[code]import sqlite3\\\\ndb = sqlite3.connect(somefilename)\\\\nquery = db.execute(\\'SELECT key, value FROM keyvals\\')\\\\nresults = {k:v for k,v in query.fetchall()}\\\\n[/code]But, of course, the SELECT statement could be arbitrarily more complex. It could use all of the SQL WHERE and HAVING clauses, could include self JOIN statements and sub-queries, use ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET, and so on.\\\\n\\\\n(In my example I\\\\u2019m loading the entire table as a dictionary; but we could access subsets of this data on demand. Also this example would work even if you defined that table, or altered it, to include additional columns. In other database statements you could fetch additional data. You could also define additional tables and SQLite will store all of them in the same file).\\\\n\\\\nIn addition the SQLite3 libraries will automatically handle file/record locking and provide transactional support. So, much of those aspects of data/file handling are simply taken care of behind-the-scenes. (That\\\\u2019s particularly handy if you\\\\u2019re working with data which might ever be concurrently accessed by multiple processes, even on the same system or when the file is stored on a networked filesystem such as NFS).\\\\n\\\\nAnother advantage of SQLite data files (similar to the advantage of JSON) is that the data will be readily accessible from many different languages.\\\\n\\\\nIt may seem like I\\\\u2019ve gone far afield from your original question. But this serves a purpose. If you only learn the simplest way to write data into a file then you won\\\\u2019t be well prepared for the real world scenarios where you should be asking questions like:\\\\n\\\\n * How will this data be used later?\\\\n * Will I always want to load the entire data set into memory?\\\\n * How will it be updated and maintained? How frequently?\\\\n * Will it ever be used concurrently? For read-only or with possible write contention?\\\\n * Does this data need to be access by other systems or code written in other languages? What are my interoperability concerns?\\\\n * How can I ensure the data\\\\u2019s integrity? How can I handle any data corruption or formatting issues?\\\\nI hope this will be helpful, to you and others, well beyond the immediate question.\", \"',\n",

More and more foodstuffs entered the household as \\\\u201cheat and serve\\\\u201d (increasingly to be processed within that other great kitchen time-saving advance of the 1970s, the microwave oven). The handling and preparation of raw ingredients became associated with not having anything \\\\u201cbetter\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cmore important\\\\u201d to do. Dousing and heating a pre-portioned, freeze-dried mix became associated with a modern, \\\\u201cspace-age\\\\u201d way of life. One of the great marketing phenomenons of the time, Hamburger Helper, required the addition of \\\\u201cfresh\\\\u201d (or frozen) ground beef - itself likely processed and packaged - intended to encourage a sense that one was still cooking.\\\\n\\\\nOften, however, a box was simply emptied into a pan of water, brought to a boil and served (e.g., Mac \\\\u2019N Cheese; still as popular as the day it was introduced). Many of these \\\\u201cconvenience\\\\u201d foods were largely starch based and fetishized as \\\\u201clow-fat\\\\u201d (another tragic commercial mania), which often necessitated the addition of synthesized ingredients such as stabilizers, gums and syrups to make up for flavor and texture deficits (many components of flavor are fat-soluble).\\\\n\\\\nSuch manufactured preparations are, in a word, sticky. Starches are also exceptionally susceptible to burning quickly at relatively low temperatures (the pyrolysis point of carbohydrates is significantly lower than that of other macronutrients [ https://www.huffpost.com/entry/browned-food-maillard-reaction_n_56015265e4b0fde8b0cfae02 ]). As anyone who has let the Mac&Cheese go too long in an unlined pan knows, often more than just dinner is ruined.\\\\n\\\\nIn the 1950s a French company, Tefal, pioneered the application of the exceptionally slick byproduct of an industrial accident, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene ]), to an inexpensive stamped aluminum pan and non-stick cookware was born. Dupont, the originator of Teflon (as PTFE was to be branded) licensed its use to myriad cookware manufacturers, and Teflon\\\\u2019s advance in the market place neatly paced the growth of starchy, sweet, sticky, shelf-stable manufactured foods.\\\\n\\\\nAgain, at the time this was all thought to be extremely progressive. Convenience foods would free women to join the workforce while providing their families with \\\\u201ctasty and nutritious meals in minutes\\\\u201d. This suited the convenience of large corporations very well, as most of these meals were comprised of a shrinking list of commodity inputs, such as corn [ https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1074810043495796736 ], its derivatives (including \\\\u201ccorn-fed\\\\u201d beef) and soy, both of which could be produced increasingly cheaply and intensively across ever broader swathes of the US mid-west, conveniently (and cheaply) fertilized with repurposed ammonium-nitrate-based chemicals originally stockpiled as explosives during the Second World War. The steady expansion of the labor pool alongside advances in automation has steadily driven down per unit labor costs over the past half century. Heightened competition within the labor pool for increasingly scarce middle-class jobs [ https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/01/10/the-outlook-is-dim-for-americans-without-college-degrees ] has contributed to the decline of labor unions, the shriveling of non-salary benefits, the massive rise in college tuitions, and the advent of the gig economy. That many of the manufacturing operations required to produce both food and cookware were among the first US jobs to be either automated and/or out-sourced further added to the bottom line of manufacturing, agricultural, food processing and chemical industries.\\\\n\\\\nAs Americans got thicker and thicker from steady consumption of cheaper and cheaper, nutritionally questionable manufactured foods, our cooking skills atrophied along with our health (enter the pharmaceutical and medical industries). Well-made cookware faded in importance along with a well-made meal, and pots and pans themselves became thought of as disposable within the tidy, convenience-oriented kitchen (indeed, many US apartments constructed in the 1980s and 1990s were equipped with just a counter, sink and room for a microwave, disposing as much with the idea as the necessity of cookware almost entirely).\\\\n\\\\nEven the most robust non-stick pan linings are reduced to flaking films after only light use in less than 10 years, and usually in less than 5, leaving essentially a useless husk of cheaply stamped metal flecked with plastic shreds. According to the Cookware Manufacturers Association (in 2015), no non-stick cookware produced before 1999 is likely to still be in use. This fact represents a reliable replacement market for plastic-coated pans, but it also represents the addition of millions of tons of unstable and toxic polymerized petrochemicals to our landfills, and the infiltration of their byproducts (especially perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid ]), one of the most pervasive and carcinogenic man-made compounds known) into our ground water and soils. PFOA is also the chief toxic byproduct of PTFE manufacture, and for decades was simply dumped into rivers and into open pits [ https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/nyregion/hoosick-falls-tainted-water-hearings.html ].\\\\n\\\\nTo the question of whether traditional cookware such as copper is outdated, the answer with respect to the foregoing would be emphatically no. Rather, copper lined with tin may be considered uncommonly \\\\u201cgreen\\\\u201d in that every component of a typical piece is not only 100% recyclable, but such cookware almost never sees the scrap yard because it can restored to like-new condition for a fraction of the replacement cost. The service life of tin-lined copper cookware is measured not in years, not even in generations, but in centuries. These days a significant portion of new copper cookware is formed of recycled metal, with the remaining percentage new copper being smelted with many times less energy and waste [ http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/10/AR2009061000981.html?noredirect=on (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/10/AR2009061000981.html?noredirect=on) ] than iron, aluminum or the other popular cookware metal, stainless steel.\\\\n\\\\nWith minor upkeep, cast iron is in the same league as copper for durability, with many, many thousands of centenarian pans still in service in the US alone. While rust and caustic exposures can pit cast iron to the point of failure, lightly pitted and even heavily rusted pans can be resurfaced, reseasoned and put back to use. Refined iron, aka carbon steel, is likewise susceptible to oxidative degradation, but in most cases can be restored to service with minimal effort.\\\\n\\\\nPure metal cookware is, as a practical matter, indefinitely renewable; even as an ancient technology it\\\\u2019s as ecologically up-to-date as solar energy and electric vehicles. That it is many times more expensive than disposable cookware accrues not only to its far greater utility for time-tested and safe preparation of real foods, but to the facts that fabricating or casting pure metal cookware requires a lot of hand work and is today only a small fraction of overall cookware production. This results in far higher unit costs. However, one buys a tin-lined copper pot or cast iron frying pan once and then uses for the rest of life, passing it down to heirs, and heirs of heirs. The lifetime cost of a new pure metal pan of any type, even with periodic restoration, is on average significantly less in both nominal and constant dollar terms than regular disposal and replacement of a pan with an intentionally short design life.\\\\n\\\\nBecause the manufacturing costs of copper, iron and carbon steel on the secondary markets have been amortized down to zero, prices there are subject to simple supply and demand. There is a lot of supply of pure metal on the secondary markets these days, and often a good quality pure metal pan needing perhaps slight restoration can be had for a quarter the price (or less) of an equivalent new piece. Nearly any used pure copper or iron pan will perform significantly better than a brand new mid-to-upper grade stainless or aluminum pan of the same configuration, and will do so longer and for less total cost of acquisition and restoration.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a triumph of marketing that cooking and the tools used to perform this most biologically essential task ever fell into disrepute. Fortunately, interest in decent ingredients, land and animal husbandry, the health of soils, the cleanliness of the water supply and, finally, the performance and material qualities of the tools used to convert raw nutrients into the energy by which we sustain and enhance our own lives, are filtering back into common consciousness. The wholesale abdication of our ability to feed ourselves to profit-driven enterprises has shifted incentives from nutritional value to shareholder value and from long-term stewardship to short-term return on investment. The results are the despoliation of Earth\\\\u2019s surface, water and air, the ever tighter concentration of financial wealth, and ever larger swathes of humanity abandoned to the ravages of industrial malaise.\\\\n\\\\nPost-industrial communication techniques are enabling me to write and share this essay, so I\\\\u2019m far from indicting the entirety of corporate modernity. As it applies to biology, ours in particular but also the planet\\\\u2019s generally, paying attention to how humanity provided for itself prior to the advent of adding dubious \\\\u201cvalue\\\\u201d for profit\\\\u2019s sake is, I think, instructive as well as desirable. Pure metal cookware predates the industrial revolution and has been been improved by it, but as ingredients in sound cooking modern pure metal vessels are functionally indistinguishable from those relied upon by humanity since antiquity.\", \"',\n",

Getting a buildup on both the inside and outside of a cast iron skillet or pot is not unusual. I clean mine by using a stiff bamboo brush to remove debris with just a bit of water while heating on the stove. Just like deglazing, it removes all the solids and leaves the oil coating behind. Once this is finished, I rinse with warm water and place in a cool oven to dry. Later, I take it out, lightly oil with some canola or vegetable oil, and put it away. When I oil the skillet, I will always get a bit of coloration because of the carbon and oils.

       "   3: ': \"Over the years, the consensus that harms of antibacterial soaps outweigh their benefits has indeed coalesced. But to understand how antibacterial soaps could harm, we first need to understand how they differ from regular soaps. Also referred to as antimicrobial or antiseptic soaps, they contain chemicals that regular soaps don\\'t.\\\\n\\\\nMany liquid soaps labeled antibacterial contain Triclosan [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan ], a synthetic compound, specifically a phenylether or chlorinated bisphenol. While the US FDA classifies it as a Class III drug, i.e., a compound with high solubility and low permeability, Triclosan is also a pesticide. Triclocarban [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclocarban ] is another common chemical found in antibacterial soaps. Many of the concerns about Triclosan also apply to Triclocarban (1 [ http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/5/5657 ]).\\\\n\\\\nSince it appeared on the scene in 1972, Triclosan has steadily permeated through the consumer landscape such that it\\'s practically ubiquitous today (see lists below from 1 and 2 [ http://emerald.tufts.edu/med/apua/consumers/personal_home_21_4240495089.pdf ]).\\\\n\\\\nTriclosan\\'s so ubiquitous it\\'s even found embedded in medical devices such as catheters and sutures to prevent infections (3 [ http://carambola.usc.edu/BiofilmReferences/FoleyCathedersLancet2003.pdf ]).\\\\n\\\\nAs for its beneficial effect, a 2015 study compared bactericidal effect of plain versus Triclosan-containing soaps in conditions that mimic hand washing, and found no difference in their ability to reduce bacterial numbers during a 20 second exposure (4). In other words, dubious benefit when used for routine hand washing under normal circumstances, i.e., only washing hands for a few seconds. After all, most of us don\\'t scrub as though preparing to do surgery every time we wash our hands.\\\\n\\\\nHow Triclosan [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triclosan ], A Common Antibacterial Soap Ingredient Inhibits/Kills Microbes\\\\n\\\\nIn vitro studies show Triclosan can stop bacteria growing at low concentrations (bacteriostatic), and kill them at high concentrations (bactericidal). It also has some activity against some fungi (5) and even parasites such as those that cause malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, and toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii (6 [ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Russell_Lyons/publication/12092002_McLeod_R_et_al_Triclosan_inhibits_the_growth_of_Plasmodium_falciparum_and_Toxoplasma_gondii_by_inhibition_of_apicomplexan_Fab_I_Int_J_Parasitol_31_109-113/links/004635204356975607000000.pdf ]).\\\\n\\\\nTriclosan is able to target many different types of bacteria by blocking the active site for an enzyme essential for bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis (7, 8). Blocking the enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, Triclosan prevents bacteria from synthesizing fatty acid, which they need for their cell membranes and for reproduction.\\\\n\\\\nProblems With Triclosan\\\\n\\\\nI. Triclosan selects for antibiotic resistance\\\\n\\\\nAs widespread Triclosan use increased, labs increasingly started finding cross-resistance to antibiotics. Under selection pressure from Triclosan, bacteria mutate to develop resistance mechanisms to it, which end up bestowing antibiotic resistance as well. In other words, studies show Triclosan selects for antibiotic resistance (see table below from 9 [ http://femsle.oxfordjournals.org/content/femsle/202/1/1.full.pdf ]).\\\\n\\\\nII. Discharged Widely Into The Environment, Triclosan Can Affect Biomass Such As Algae & Bacterial Communities\\\\n\\\\nSince it\\'s widely used in such a diverse array of products, Triclosan ends up in soil, ground water and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Such plants require proper functioning of microbes to break down sewage. Triclosan can inhibit methane production in wastewater plant anaerobic digesters as well as select for multidrug resistance in such bacterial communities (10 [ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patrick_Mcnamara2/publication/262977264_The_Impacts_of_Triclosan_on_Anaerobic_Community_Structures_Function_and_Antimicrobial_Resistance/links/54e364290cf2be54da85c5e7.pdf ]). Triclosan\\'s effects persist even beyond because it\\'s discharged from wastewater treatment plants as effluent. Certain algae species in the vicinity of such plants have been found to be very sensitive to Triclosan (11, 12 [ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Topp/publication/272625256_Resilience_and_recovery_The_effect_of_triclosan_exposure_timing_during_development_on_the_structure_and_function_of_river_biofilm_communities/links/553e3dad0cf20184050de010.pdf ]). Triclosan also affects bacterial communities in rivers (13 [ http://www.clipmedia.net/galera/ICRA/NdP/2010/120710_estudiS_SCARCE/TRI2010.pdf ]). Potential environmental risk of Triclosan becomes even more relevant in areas of water scarcity where it doesn\\'t get sufficiently diluted.\\\\n\\\\nIII.

Triclosan Bans\\\\n\\\\nGiven the increasing litany of concerns about Triclosan\\'s deleterious effects on the physiology of a wide variety of species, which may also increasingly include humans, several governments are either considering banning it or have already done so.\\\\n\\\\n * In March 2010, the European Union banned Triclosan from any products that may come into contact with food (2 [ http://emerald.tufts.edu/med/apua/consumers/personal_home_21_4240495089.pdf ]).\\\\n * On 16 May, 2014, the US state of Minnesota banned the sale of Triclosan-containing cleaning products (soaps), giving manufacturers time until early 2017 to phase them out (24 [ https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=SF2192&y=2014&ssn=0&b=senate ]).\\\\n * As of 2015, Health Canada was considering banning Triclosan. It\\'s estimated ~1730 products including cosmetics, health and personal care products containing Triclosan were available in Canada in 2011 (1 [ http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/5/5657 ]).\\\\n * The US FDA is mulling its regulation (25), with a report due in September 2016.\\\\nBibliography\\\\n\\\\n1.

Nor can the bacteria, because the mouth is inhabited by (in the absence of such diseases) a balance of both good and bad bacteria. \\\\n\\\\nOnly regular mechanical disruption using toothbrush, tongue scrapers, or flossing can reduce the amount of plaque in your mouth; also through semi-annual visits to your dentist to have your teeth scaled and polished. These methods can prevent the so-called \\\\\"balance\\\\\" from tipping and the bad bacteria from dominating the oral environment, because these organisms thrive in areas deprived or low in oxygen---a perfect example would be deep in undisrupted plaque.\\\\n\\\\nNote that bacteria in plaque is enclosed in a biofilm so it cannot be removed by simply spraying or swishing something inside the mouth like your breath sprays or over-the-counter mouth rinses (unless it can actually destroy the bacteria\\'s outer layer etc. like a specific amount or dose of Chlorhexidine rinse. But that\\'s an entirely different topic.)\\\\n\\\\nSo, for example, you can use breath sprays or mouth rinses all you want but you will just \\\\\"feel\\\\\" a slightly fresher breath, but in reality it would not be technically so.\\\\n\\\\nBottomlime is... as from experience, you may or may not have observed the \\\\\"refreshing\\\\\" effects of cleaning your tongue, however, the people around you may have noticed your fresher breath. Also, you can use the bristles of a regular toothbrush to do so, or a tongue cleaner especially designed to do the job, whichever works for you. :)\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"The best toothbrushes are the ones that will remove the most amount of plaque in the shortest of time, without damaging your gums and teeth, are easy to use, and are also affordable.\\\\n\\\\nThen there is the question, should I use an electric or a manual toothbrush?\\\\n\\\\nIf you have the same cleaning results with a manual toothbrush as an electric one, why bother? Maybe you need more time and technique to get your result using manual, but then it\\'s just a reason for ease using an electric one.\\\\n\\\\nIs there such a toothbrush? It\\'s\\'s like asking, is a BMW a better car than a Volkswagen or a Lada? Every each of them will bring you from A to B.\\\\n\\\\nThen again, It seems very personal. While one toothbrush works with one person, it will work less for another person.\\\\n\\\\nManufacturers of electric toothbrushes eagerly want us to believe the benefits, but the manual toothbrush gets good results.\\\\n\\\\nAll-day we are exposed to commercial products which will promise you the best.\\\\n\\\\nHow to brushing your teeth has become something like rocket science,\\\\n\\\\nespecially for the electric toothbrushes market.\\\\n\\\\nRemember an electric toothbrush. It\\'s just a tool.\\\\n\\\\nYou shouldn\\'t buy an electric toothbrush just because you think it will accomplish something for you that most other people couldn\\'t. Also, because the scientific evidence supporting the benefit of using a powered brush is not convincingly and proven present.\\\\n\\\\nInstead, you should think in terms of an electric toothbrush as being just a tool whose features may help you to affirm whatever brushing problems you have. And if you determine that it can, then getting one makes a good idea. Electric toothbrushes seem more effective at removing plaque than manual ones.\\\\n\\\\nSome 3-months and 6-months trials showed that electric toothbrushes reduce more of the amount of plaque and gum disease than manual toothbrushes. Also, it seems that rotating( oscillating ) toothbrushes work better than vibrating ones.\\\\n\\\\nThe question is, then, where is the research covering years of research and studies proving electric toothbrushes are far better than manual toothbrushes? Well, there aren\\'t any. Long-term comparison studies between electric and manual toothbrushing give the same results for cleaning quality.\\\\n\\\\n-So what seem the pros of electric toothbrushes?\\\\n\\\\nElectric toothbrushes seem easier for people with limited mobility.\\\\n\\\\nElectric toothbrushes will do most of the work for you. They may be practical for anyone with limited mobility, like arthritis and developmental disabilities.\\\\n\\\\nMay improve oral health in people with orthodontic appliances.\\\\n\\\\nThere is a study that found electric toothbrushes were more helpful for people with braces. When you find it challenging to brush when having braces and are more comfortable with an electric toothbrush, it may improve your oral health.\\\\n\\\\nBrushing motivation.\\\\n\\\\nSome people lack the motivation to brush. If so, electricity might be what they need.\\\\n\\\\nElectric toothbrushes come with a timer.\\\\n\\\\nA timer may be helpful because when evenly spent time on all your teeth for brushing, most people need about 2 minutes; your result will not be as good when spending less time.\\\\n\\\\nElectric toothbrushes can be fun for kids.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, not all kids are interested in brushing their teeth with a manual toothbrush. If an electric toothbrush is more appealing to your child, it can help achieve good oral cleaning and set a healthy routine.\\\\n\\\\n-Let\\'s talk about the cons of electric toothbrushes\\\\n\\\\nElectric toothbrushes are far more expensive to buy and are costly to maintain.\\\\n\\\\nYou can get an electric toothbrush for about $40 up to almost $ 300. Also, it would be best if you had batteries and bristle heads. Every at least three months, you have to replace your electric toothbrush bristle head. You have to find the right bristle head for your device, and that may be a nuisance because they are not everywhere available. Building a stock of bristle heads, which is costly again, seems the best solution then.\\\\n\\\\nYour electric toothbrush, which is an electrical device, can stop just working because of whatever reason.\\\\n\\\\nAnd then you have to repurchase a new one.\\\\n\\\\nPlug-in versions seem not a good option.\\\\n\\\\nEspecially if you are traveling a lot internationally, you will need a backup travel toothbrush, which may not be a good option.\\\\n\\\\nNot eco friendly.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the needs for electricity and batteries make the electric toothbrush not eco-friendly at all.\\\\n\\\\n-What are the benefits of a manual toothbrush?\\\\n\\\\nManual toothbrushes as we know them are there since 1938.\\\\n\\\\nThey don\\'t have the bells and whistles you may find in many electric toothbrushes. But they are handy for teeth cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nManual toothbrushes are very accessible.\\\\n\\\\nManual toothbrushes sell at almost any grocery store, gas station, dollar store, or pharmacy. Manual toothbrushes also don\\'t need batteries to be charged to function, so that you can use a manual toothbrush everywhere, anywhere, and at any time.\\\\n\\\\nManual toothbrushes are very affordable.\\\\n\\\\nIn being affordable manual toothbrushes are cost-effective. They come cheap, like you may buy one for $1 to $3.\\\\n\\\\n-Cons of manual toothbrushes.\\\\n\\\\nIncorrect use of the toothbrush.\\\\n\\\\nIt is not correct, putting too much pressure on the teeth and gums, which will cause wear and pain.\\\\n\\\\nWith every toothbrushing comes common sense; don\\'t use too much power and pressure when cleaning your teeth; this applies both for manual and electric toothbrushes. All the mentioned benefits of an electric toothbrush only apply when properly used.\\\\n\\\\nIt seems that the best toothbrush is the one that will give you the best feel when using it. Don\\'t expect to be far better off with an electric toothbrush when you are perfectly comfortable with your manual toothbrush, assuming you are brushing consciously, with the right technique and common sense.\", \"',\n",

And viruses need a host to survive.

Don\\'t buy their product.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who want to know why, read on.\\\\n\\\\nThe Experience:\\\\n\\\\nI have used none of those products, but I have purchased Milagrow Blackcat. I can\\'t tell you about products that you asked, but I can definitely tell you about Milagrow company, which is super-cheat, and I consider it my duty to my countrymen to alert anyone who is willing to buy it.\\\\n\\\\nI first bought their product on ebay in 2012, and going forward, had little use of it. As a result, it remained idle. Probably due to that, or some inherent fault, the device stopped charging. It was then that my problems started.\\\\n\\\\n * When I tried contacting their support in my city, I found that all those support shopkeepers had stopped supporting for Milagrow. I grew suspicious and called Milagrow  customer care - who informed me that they had stopped giving onsite customer care. All they could do was, they could repair it in their Gurgaon repair center, which will cost me shipping charge Rs 500. I was quite annoyed to hear it, and had some hassles in my life so I couldn\\'t send the device.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n * When I became free I once again decided to repair it. But at that time the product warranty got expired. It was at that time that I had to do the inevitable - I decided to send the device to their support center. Not that it was easy, even with paying them Rs 750. There was quite some hassles with Bluedart who demanded custom duty - and I had hard time convincing them this was for repair. Milagrow repair had no idea how to deal with such shipping, yet they keep suggesting people about shelling out the shipping charge.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n * The next email I received from them, after many followups about repair status, was this:\\\\n * I was floored! Rs 10250 for out-of-warranty product purchased for Rs 11500! God help me! I argued with the same logic, to which I kept receiving their stubborn responses about \\'product out of warranty\\'. \\\\n * Some gems:\\\\n * \\\\n * Why are you so pissed off bro, purchase another crappy vacuum cleaner for about same price, that simple! As if my entire family was dying of dust without a robot that cleaned the floor.\\\\n\\\\n * \\\\n * Upon my argument that \\\\\"how could you justify selling me another thing of the same kind when your original one grew faulty without use?\\\\\" - they came up with this ultra-techno-support reason: \\\\\"PCBA damaged!\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n * \\\\n * I was like: \\\\\"Hell, what did I do to damage the PCBA? During my years as an engineer, I had PCBAs at my disposal, and I barely touched those just in case, to measure up the voltage. What did I do with this cylindrical vermin to extract the raw bits n pieces and speared them one by one, so as to damage the entire product?\\\\\" \\\\n * I asked them gently over the phone, could you mention what kind of atrocities could possibly damage PCBA, to which I got age-old answer of an electric shopkeeper - \\\\\"electronic items sir, no warranties, no guarantees. Stop breaking your head!\\\\\"\\\\n * Those days were gloomy days. I was really out of my senses to recollect that I had barely used the product for half a dozen times during 3 years! If there was truly a thing I could have done to damage the PCBA, I would surely categorize it as a sin. \\\\n * But then, how could the makers not include such a thing inside their manual? Even mobiles worth Rs 1100 with roughest use n wear and tear, run for a decade without any damage to their PCBAs. \\\\n * This was supposed to be a robotic vacuum cleaner, armed with Artificial intelligence. My natural intelligence argued vehemently against every logic, and was royally defeated.\\\\n * I emailed the makers with each new arguments that could turn the case in an aggrieved customer\\'s favor. I even copied the CEO - to no avail. I even broadcast my experience on eBay forums in order to fetch their attention, to no result. \\\\n\\\\n * Finally, defeated, I decided to shell out Rs 10250, just in case for once, to be able to justify my coming-of age purchase from an Indian appliance manufacturer. I simply asked them how much warranty will they offer if I decided to repair it for the cost of a new device. \\\\n * For first three successive emails, I didn\\'t receive any response. They were probably forming up a policy that addressed my concern! I was their first customer who was ready to repair an out of warranty product for a price of full, but in return, wanted at least \\\\\"some warranty\\\\\".

They made doubly sure I deposited the shipping cost to their account only, then they dispatched it via Bluedart, with the cheapest delivery option available. The courier person refused to deliver at home, and we had to head for the courier office to collect the piece. \\\\n * The piece, which cost me Rs 11500 + Rs 500 (for repair shipping) = Rs 12000, lay idle at my home for 2 months, during which I gave serious thought about how could I get Milagrow pay me for the repair and mental agony. \\\\n * Hell, how could I get them at least repair it for 5000 bucks. I was ready to pay for the battery, a component that can be reasonably damaged by human and environment. But I wasn\\'t ready to pay them for the PCBA damage which is the heart of the product they sold to me.\\\\n * After 2 months, an engineer within told me something. I started scouting for an electronic repair shop within my city. I setup a simple test to choose they guy who will do the most mundane repairs. I set out to solder my damaged iphone charger. My target was to find someone, who will work for the joy of doing it, and not cheat customers for faulty spare parts, lousy solder, and eventually damage the product with hefty service fee. \\\\n * I found that somebody who soldered my charger for meagre 10 Rs. I keenly observed how he handled things with care, and how he didn\\'t take advantage of someone who owned an iPhone 5c but wasn\\'t ready to replace the USB adapter. I made my choice.\\\\n * The next day, my blackcat vacuum cleaner lay on his desk. He gave me the service fee figure. Rs 200 for the labor if it failed. And he will tell me the cost if he could fix it.\\\\n * Later in the day, I got his call, quoting the repair charge of Rs 450. I heard him twice - and I wanted to correct him in case he was mistaken. But he wasn\\'t.\\\\n * The next day when I visited his shop - I was expecting that he only half repaired it without understanding the fault. I was ready to witness a completely damaged appliance. How the hell could off-the-street repairer fix something that cost Rs 10250 to the service staff of a leading appliance manufacturing company, something that India can really be proud of?\\\\n * But I was wrong. There he was, playing with the remote, moving the black robot on his floor, completely at his commands. The device was fully charged. It was the Aha moment I was waiting for, and it completely belonged to him!\\\\n * Happily, I paid him Rs 500, packed the appliance, and headed for home. After 10 steps, I heard a shout over my shoulder. The guy was rushing towards me with Rs 50 bill in his hands. I feigned ignorance, \\\\\"What\\'s that?\\\\\" \\\\\"Sir, I told you it only costs Rs 450. Take Rs 50 back.\\\\\" And he returned quickly after handling me the bill, discarding all my urgings.\\\\n * I described the incident to 10 other people in my family, and they were all proud - not of myself - but of our small town boys who were honest and brilliant in their own small world.

But since I always have difficulty with finding my old answers on Quora, I will go through this one more time (and save the link for future reference).\\\\n\\\\nIn the distant past (at least in computer years), PC meant any computer that was IBM based, using a Microsoft OS, whether laptop or desktop.  Currently, PC seems to mean your standard desktop unit.  I make this distinction simply because the two devices are dissimilar in how to open them up and clean them physically, and I want to clarify I am understanding the question as meaning the current definition.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, there is your physical cleaning.  \\\\n\\\\nManufacturers of brand name computers all have proprietary case styles, along with configurations that may create some confusion.  So let\\'s start with your basic setup, first:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis is an image of an older model, but the outline remains relatively the same.  There are three areas to pay attention to, though.  Your main focus is cleaning the cooling areas, specifically your fans and vent areas.  If you notice in the graphic, the CPU fan is just near the power unit fan and the rear vent.  This is not always the case, and the power supply fan may be internal.\\\\n\\\\nAnyway, get yourself a cheap can of compressed air, or an air compressor if your more inclined to less harmful solutions. Basically, you want to blow down the inside of the computer.  Do this outside, since in many cases, the computer can sport a lot of dust in hidden spots.\\\\n\\\\nIf you look really closely at the graphic provided, you will notice the cooling fins under the CPU fan are actually crusted with dirt.  This is your typical computer killer, since it prevents the efficient cooling of the hottest part of your computer.  You can usually remove the fan from the heat sink by undoing the four screws that hold it in, not the ones the connect it to the motherboard.  You can see these here as holes in the black fan frame.  Once you remove the fan, a clean, soft bristle paintbrush can be used to remove that crusted dirt.\\\\n\\\\nYou\\'re done when you don\\'t see any chunky dirt or ghost turds floating around.\\\\n\\\\nWith some brand name models, a vent conduit may be placed on over the CPU to maximize air flow.  These are usually easy to remove, but you have to ensure you do to get the best cleaning.\\\\n\\\\n* For a laptop, the best way to clean internally is really just to blow compressed air into the vent outlet, usually located on the left side.  This should remove some of the dirt on your cooling surfaces.  To do a more thorough cleaning involves some dis assembly, and if you aren\\'t comfortable with doing this, I would suggest finding someone who is.\\\\n\\\\nExternally, just wipe down your surfaces with a damp rag, Windex or rubbing alcohol.  Keyboards may be a more complex issue, but removing the keys (and placing them neatly on the table in the same order they belong in will make for an easier reassembly) is not hard, just time consuming. Some longer keys may have a wire swivel attached to them.  Be gentle with these and don\\'t lose the wire.  However, if you break something, keyboards are cheap and easily replaceable.\\\\n\\\\nCleaning your OS is a bit more of an effort.\\\\n\\\\nDownload the following...\\\\n\\\\nGo to WWW.NINITE.COM [ http://WWW.NINITE.COM ], select and install these programs:\\\\n * Revo\\\\n * Malwarbytes Anti Malware\\\\n * one of the antivirus programs (only if you don\\'t already have a CURRENTLY active antivirus).  I normally use AVG, but there are several good ones to choose from.\\\\nNow, go to Piriform.com [ http://WWW.PIRIFORM.COM ], download and install these programs:\\\\n * CC Cleaner\\\\n * Defraggler\\\\nRun these programs in this order to maximize your cleaning:\\\\n * Empty your Recycle Bin.  Just right click on it and tell it to empty.\\\\n\\\\n * Revo.  This is a program that uninstalls other programs better than their own uninstall utility.  Select and remove any programs you don\\'t use, or don\\'t think you need anymore.  Revo will run the normal uninstaller, then find and remove any left over files and registry entries.  There may be some risk in doing this, but I use it regularly and haven\\'t had any problems.\\\\n * CC Cleaner.  There are several utilities in this program.   \\\\n * \\\\n1. First, run the Cleaner by clicking on the analyze button.  This will look for stray and temp files that can be cleaned up.  After the analysis, run the Cleaner button. \\\\n2. Click on Registry, then scan for issues.  When complete, fix the selected issues.  CC Cleaner will ask if you want to back up prior to the changes.  Say yes.  I have used this extensively, but have had one instance where the registry was damaged.\\\\n3. Finally, select Tools, then Startup.  Look down your list of startup items and disable those you don\\'t want to start when your computer does.  Things like Google Update, Java Updater, Quicktime Updater, and so on, can be disabled.  If you find something you\\'re not sure about, Google the information.  There are actually only a few things that need to start with Windows, so you can regain a lot of speed by turning off some of these startups.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n * Reboot.  This starts clean without your disabled startups, and verifies everthing is working fine.  You can always run CC Cleaner again and re-enable the startups you want if something isn\\'t right.\\\\n\\\\n * Check for updates to your antivirus, then do a really good run with it.  * Lately, I\\'ve been seeing a lot of comments and answers claiming an antivirus is unnecessary, maybe even detrimental.  Don\\'t listen to them.  Some programmers and other techs don\\'t mind taking chances, but going without an antivirus is irresponsible, and can affect not only you, but anyone you connect to.  The alternative is much worse.\\\\n\\\\n * Reboot.\\\\n * Check for updates to Malwarebytes Anti Malware, then run a scan.  This is not an antivirus, but will find certain types of spyware and other unwanted programs, often loaded by just visiting certain websites.\\\\n * Reboot.\\\\n * Run Microsoft Windows Update.  This will make sure you have the latest updates, including the malicious software removal tool.\\\\n * If there were any updates, reboot.\\\\n * If you have a standard hard drive, run Defraggler (solid state drives don\\'t require this, and it may even be harmful).  After all the removals and cleaning, your hard drive will look like swiss cheese, and defragging will put together most of the fragmented files so the computer doesn\\'t spend a lot of time looking for all the parts.\\\\n * After all this, ensure you have a automatic schedule set up for updating and running your antivirus.  Defraggler also has a utility for scheduling regular defrags. Once a month is probably ok.\\\\nYou should notice a difference in speed and operation now.\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \"Short answer : no.\\\\n\\\\nLong answer: depends - on how old and what condition the car is in, how long you plan to hold on to the car and whether you have any expectation of getting decent resale value. Buy one only you\\\\u2019re a driving enthusiast (what? you still love driving despite this choking traffic) and want a safe, sturdy car with good dynamics with poor brand image, over a fuel efficient , popular but not as safe set of wheels.\\\\n\\\\nLegally speaking, manufacturers are required to support (via spare parts and service availability) their vehicles for minimum of 7 years after manufacture stops. That means Fiat is legally bound to provide spares and service till at least 2024, assuming the last built Fiat was in 2017.\\\\n\\\\nSome aftermarket suppliers/OEM supplies will continue to manufacture parts even after that 7 year period, as there are and will be tens of thousands of Fiats (Linea and Punto models) still in use then. As this count dwindles, spares will get harder to find, though some could be substituted with other brand cars. At least for next 3\\\\u20134 years, OEM parts should be available on order, if not off the shelft. After that, you\\\\u2019ll likely have to search wide and far. Some enterprising owners and enthusiasts might source parts from abroad or get custom parts fabricated from local garages.\\\\n\\\\nFiat\\\\u2019s sales have dropped so low, there likely won\\\\u2019t be any new Fiat models anytime soon and this year both the Linea and Punto could be discontinued and the company could even exit the market like GM did, though for now it seems to be trying to stay in India but focused on the Jeep brand so another 2\\\\u20133 years of FCA present is expected. So in terms of resale value and dealer support, it will only get worse, although Fiat has their MOPAR initiative to address spare parts and service to customers. Resale value will plummet too, so if you plan to use a Fiat only for short term, don\\\\u2019t. If you plan to keep it for several years, it can be done but lose all hope of a good resale price.\\\\n\\\\nSo, if you intend to keep it running in pristine condition for many years to come easily and cheaply, that won\\\\u2019t happen. With some time and effort on your part to source or custom-make parts you can definitely keep the car running in good stead, but it likely won\\\\u2019t be a simple \\\\u2018drop it off at the dealer and collect it later\\\\u2019 affair, in a few years - you\\\\u2019ll have to patronize local or brand name chain garages for service and parts as authorized dealerships quit to switch to more profitable brands like Hyundai or Maruti.\", \"',\n",

This may not be the case everywhere. In such testing times, the need of the hour is to maintain an environment free of viruses, germs & bacteria in local physical shops. What does this mean? This means that besides maintaining social distancing and using hand sanitizers for customers, it is important for shop owners to sanitise and disinfect their shops from time to time which includes the hands of staff, owners & customers, air, surfaces, floor & the environment. Remember, an organized and disinfected shop will always be customer\\\\u2019s first preference in the pandemic & give them the assurance to visit shops physically. Here\\\\u2019s how you can assure that your shop is free of viruses, germs & bacteria and has all that it takes for your customers and employees to feel safe and assured when shopping.\\\\n\\\\nPackage Vs Loose:The first step is to make sure that all your loose grocery is packed into ready to buy packets. This will reduce the risk of spreading viruses, germs & bacteria. People tend to put their hands into grains to check quality. This should not be an option anymore. Sanitise & Disinfect: Before opening your shop for business, make sure your regular cleaning is followed by a thorough disinfection. Go for alcohol-free, non-toxic disinfection solutions like Virosil ShopCare, that ensures every surface is 99.9% free from viruses, germs and bacteria in just 60 seconds with its fast killing action. It is trusted by brands like Croma, Hermes & shopping malls like Seasons Mall in Pune. Its Swiss alcohol free formula ensure no irritation to your staff and customers. Its long lasting effects lasts for 24 hours. Its 5 in 1 action ensures that only 1 product is required for 5 applications to disinfect hands, air, surfaces, floor & environment by diluting the solution in the respective applicator as per the application required. This makes every Virosil ShopCare pack a very economical 10X Value Pack. Virosil also provides a free applicator kit with every pack. Organize your stack: Bifurcate food and non-food items into different sections. Stack up and organize stuff meticulously into shelves and racks. Keep enough space between aisles for easy movement.\\\\n\\\\nFocus on frequent touch surfaces: Disinfect shopping baskets, trolleys, card swipe machines, fridge knobs, door handle frequently with disinfectants like Virosil ShopCare as explained above. These are high touch surfaces and can be breeding grounds for viruses, germs and bacteria. In-shop hygiene protocols: Be it a small grocery shop in a village or a big store, employees in the shop should be well versed with hygiene protocols. Washing hands with soap or using sanitizer as an application of Virosil ShopCare, supervising the customers and helping them with their needs so that they do not go about unnecessary frisking in aisles etc. should be managed well in the stores. Shopping for essentials is not only a customer\\\\u2019s anxiety but also a shop owner\\\\u2019s dilemma. Fear of contracting deadly viruses, germs & bacteria has dominated our minds with worries. Taking right precautions can help shop owners do a safe and hygienic business with people and make things sustainable and worthy.\", \"'}},\n",

Water is a solvent and understand that all solvents dissolve some things and some things they can\\\\u2019t dissolve. Stains, when dissolved, simply flush away during the cleaning process. Cleaning at home with your standard consumer washing machine dissolves things soluble in the water along with loose impacted particles for the most part simply. Stains like sugars, along with other natural things dependent on water to exist in one form or another end up going down the drain at certain points in the cleaning cycle.\\\\n\\\\nSome stains that are only partly soluble in water need some help to flush away. Hence, products like Spray and Wash are employed to help the stains to release and flush away because those spot products dissolve some things that water doesn\\\\u2019t and those stains flush away as well along with the Spray and Wash that carries away into the water along with whatever stain that ay have been affected by it. The \\\\u2018solvent\\\\u2019 used in a commercial washing machine is water.\\\\n\\\\nBasically the solvent in dry cleaning dissolves many things like oils or other solvent made things. And since the opposite is true, stains like wines, liquor, sodas, sauces, etc. do not WASH away in the dry cleaning solvent. Fortunately, the soaps made for dry cleaning, are able to hold a certain amount of water and still keep the solvent clear looking to the human eye. Too much water cannot be handled by the dry cleaning solvent and soap combination and when that happens, you end up with a milky looking unusable liquid solvent, soap, and water.\\\\n\\\\nWhen dry cleaning clothing, the used solvent cannot be dumped down the drain into the sewer. If one did, and got caught, there would be a hefty fine imposed on the Cleaners and depending on the circumstances, one could get arrested on very severe anti-pollution laws. So in dry cleaning plants the solvent is used over and over and over again and again, and again. Now you must be thinking: \\\\u201cI really don\\\\u2019t want my clothes cleaned in a liquid that has cleaned somewhere around 10K plus garments before my clothes wanted cleaned. Good cleaners, and I stress GOOD cleaners take care of their solvent.\\\\n\\\\nNew solvent is added to the machine when required, a basket located before the return pump collects anything chunky that fall off clothing as well as lint, and some things you wouldn\\\\u2019t believe. The solvent runs through a multiple filter bank constantly in the cleaning cycle adding filtered solvent to the load. So, basically the clothes are cleaned (washed) a little differently.\\\\n\\\\n1. The clothes after sorting, careful examination (some cleaners do this step - a much higher % DO NOT), pre-spotting, and weighing, are put in the machine.\\\\n2. Based upon the type of load and its weight the machine is started with timing settings adjusted as needed.\\\\n3. Traditionally, a full weight load\\\\u2019s cleaning time should be minimally 10 times the length of time it takes the solvent to reach its recommended level for the weight of load.\\\\n4. Rinsing does not happen in Dry Cleaning.\\\\n5. When the load of clothes is finished cleaning they are ready to be dried.\\\\n6. However, there is no separate machine for drying the load. The dry cleaning machines of today are called: dry-to-dry machines. The times for drying and cooling are already pre-set most of the time. In the \\\\u2018old\\\\u2019 days they did have washers and dryers in the cleaning business. You have NO idea what it was like to transfer a damp load of solvent laden clothes into the dryer. The fumes would kind of get you a little wacky - like being drunk. Sniffed enough of it long enough and it could kill you as your brain was being deprived of clean oxygen.\\\\n7. After the dryer stopped, the clothes were hung up, folded up, or laid neatly on a a cart and sent to pressing stations. Garments with spots or stains are supposed to be sent back to the cleaning department for either more spotting, re-cleaning, or given a stain tag and sent back to the pressing department or to the inspection department for assembly.\\\\nAs you can see, dry cleaning is definitely intricate and proper training these days is not used or taken advantage of like it used to. If you\\\\u2019re paying \\\\u2018cheap cheap\\\\u2019 \\\\u2018any garment cleaned for, like, \\\\u2026 $1.79\\\\u2019 each, odds are you are not getting quality service.

Good dry cleaning in any acceptable form cannot be home - period.

For the most part, especially with new machines, this completely prevents perc fumes from escaping the machine and prevents overall environmental release.\\\\n\\\\nAnother factor is that the cleaning process really represents only about 1/2 of what a dry cleaner does to a garment.

Is it because they\\\\u2019re not qualified to do anything else?\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019m willing to bet that\\\\u2019s a common misconception. I started doing cleaning about three months ago. I\\\\u2019ve been out of work for a year. I\\\\u2019ve got two associate\\\\u2019s degrees, one in office systems technology and the other in accounting technology. I also have 130 credit hours (possibly more) toward a bachelor\\\\u2019s degree (yes, I know it only requires 120 but I changed my major and transferred colleges a couple of times, so the credit requirements changed). I have 15 years of experience as an administrative assistant, able to do both secretarial work and bookkeeping. I\\\\u2019ve also worked as a spa coordinator, a file clerk for a law office, a loan processor for a mortgage company, a purchasing agent for a sign manufacturing company, and a student life specialist for the office of student engagement at our local community college. If anything, I\\\\u2019m overqualified for most of the jobs available in my field and because of a combination of situations, including the recession 12 years ago during which time I went back to college, transferring universities because of my husband finishing his degree and not being able to find work where we were living, and working for crappy employers, as well as having my last job eliminated by the community college (I wasn\\\\u2019t fired, it just looks like I was), my resume makes it look like I am not a good employee. My previous coworkers would disagree with that statement. The students I worked with at the community college would strongly disagree as well.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to that, I have gone to cosmetology school and could easily (if expensively) renew my cosmetology license and probably get a job doing hair or esthetician work. Unfortunately, I don\\\\u2019t have the tools I once did to be able to do that, which would cost even more money that I would find it hard to justify. And I\\\\u2019ve not done either in so long that there are new techniques and such that I likely don\\\\u2019t know how to do and I have no way to update my knowledge base. But technically, I could get licensed and do this.\\\\n\\\\nSo I\\\\u2019m either overqualified and they won\\\\u2019t hire me because they think I\\\\u2019ll leave if I get a better offer (I\\\\u2019m not getting any offers, so I doubt there is a chance of that) and having a spotty work history so I\\\\u2019ll leave because I\\\\u2019m a flake or I\\\\u2019m no longer licensed, so I\\\\u2019m not getting a job in my fields. With the current situation the world is in and the US in particular, I needed to be working while my husband was laid off or we would be homeless. I was willing to do just about anything that would pay my bills. A friend was looking for someone to clean her house and fold her laundry, a job she hates to do, so I agreed to do it. I wasn\\\\u2019t sure it was something I could physically do because I couldn\\\\u2019t clean my own house in one day without being out of commission the next day. But I did it and I didn\\\\u2019t hate myself in the morning. So I set up a profile on a website where people look for housekeepers and other in-home help and was contacted by a service that hires subcontractors to clean offices and houses. I\\\\u2019ve learned that this is not a job that just anyone can do. Most people can\\\\u2019t do it efficiently or thoroughly. Time is money and if you take more than a certain amount of time, you\\\\u2019re losing money for yourself and for the company. And if you aren\\\\u2019t thorough enough with an eye for detail, you wind up getting bad reviews for the company. So no, not just anyone and not just people with no job skills do this kind of work. In fact, I\\\\u2019m making more money doing this job than I would in any other job I am currently qualified for.\\\\n\\\\nWhen I do work with someone else, the person I work with most often used to work in home healthcare. So again, she is qualified to do other things and she prefers to do this. More money, less hours, and we can choose not to work weekends. It\\\\u2019s a job just like any other. I actually like that I\\\\u2019m often alone when I work and don\\\\u2019t have to deal with a micro-managing employer or lazy coworkers and often don\\\\u2019t have to deal with clients because many times they aren\\\\u2019t around when we clean.

Food Trucks Require Low Initial Investment\\\\nA food truck is considered to be a high-profit food business idea, mainly because it involves a much lower investment as against a sit-down restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nThis alone is a competitive advantage of running a food truck instead of a regular restaurant as the money you save in setting up can be used for other operations like marketing or menu engineering.\\\\n\\\\nThe only main cost is buying your truck, which is also avoidable if you take advantage of the growing food truck rental business.\\\\n\\\\nWith an old truck and re-used equipment, you can set up your food truck really quick.\\\\n\\\\nNext, you will need to outfit your truck with the right equipment, including exhausts, grillers, heat lamps, and any other specialty equipment your particular food needs.\\\\n\\\\nHow much can I be earning per month from a food truck?\\\\n\\\\nIf done right, owning a food truck can be a fairly lucrative gig for most owners. According to Off the Grid\\\\u2019s Matthew Cohen, most trucks are making an annual revenue of around $250,000 to $500,000, while the top 25 percent bring in upwards of $1 million.\\\\n\\\\n2. Food Truck Involves Relatively Low Operation Cost\\\\n\\\\nOwning a restaurant requires you to invest in expensive utilities, hire a wide range of staff including cooks, cashiers, servers, kitchen managers, cleaners, etc., and pay property tax if you are the owner of your real estate or monthly rentals if the property is on rent.\\\\n\\\\nHence, it becomes imperative for you to keep your operations cost, especially the hidden costs are many be bleeding your restaurant dry.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, the operational costs of a food truck are month-to-month and limited to food, supplies, and gas.\\\\n\\\\nYou don\\\\u2019t need to have a full staff; just a small team will do, and most of your taxes will be much lower.\\\\n\\\\nRepairs and fixes required in a restaurant can also burn a hole in your pocket. There is no denying that a brick and mortar real estate requires continuous maintenance. Maintaining furniture, electrical appliances, and other kitchen equipment, restaurant decor, leaking pipes or ceiling, etc., all require a lot of effort and of course- money.\\\\n\\\\nFood trucks, on the other hand, can do well with just a little maintenance and repairs here and there over time.\\\\n\\\\n3. Food Trucks Attract More Customers\\\\n\\\\nWith better quality food (as compared to the street vendors) at a marginally lesser price, Food Trucks have become the latest fad among the consumers as well.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s inexpensive:\\\\n\\\\nAlmost all food trucks are pocket-friendly. The famous Lalit Food Truck which was started by the Lalit Hotel on Barakhamba Road claims to target audiences that cannot afford a five-star restaurant, yet desire a scrumptious, quality meal. Since the food costs are low, you can please your customers with budget-friendly meals.\\\\n\\\\nIt Supports Good Health and Hygiene:\\\\n\\\\nFood trucks are safer and healthier as compared to street food. Food from street vendors is generally considered unsafe for consumption. With growing health consciousness, more and more people are switching to alternatives like small restaurants and food trucks.\\\\n\\\\n4. Food Trucks Can Easily Experiment with Location\\\\n\\\\nRestaurants rise and die with their location. Around 60 percent of new restaurants fail within the first year. And nearly 80 percent shut before their fifth year of operation, and one of the primary reasons being poor location and high rentals. This is why you must choose wisely while going for a food truck or a restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nFortunately, Food Trucks are immune to this problem, they are mobile, and you can choose the location of your food truck as per your choice. If your services do not seem to work well at a particular location, you can move to some other location and see if your business model is capable of thriving there.\\\\n\\\\nApart from keeping all your documents ready while you are on the move, you will have to take permissions from the RWAs before parking your food truck in posh residential areas.\\\\n\\\\nYou can use this mobility of food trucks to attract potential customers as well.\\\\n\\\\nBeing a food truck, it will be far more comfortable for you to take part in different events and food fests so you can introduce your dishes to your potential customers.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also strategically change your location on a daily or weekly basis depending on the rise and fall of footfall in some areas.\\\\n\\\\nJust remember to choose your location which is easily accessible (for cars and other vehicles), and sees ample footfall.\\\\n\\\\n5. Food Trucks Allow You to Build (Or Expand) Your Brand\\\\n\\\\nWith a mobile food van, you can build your brand at a smaller level before expanding into something more significant, such as a sit-down restaurant or possibly franchising your trucks.\\\\n\\\\nThe confusion of a few restauranteurs between going for a food truck or a regular restaurant could be solved by using a good example of both the restaurant formats.\\\\n\\\\nA good example would be Ramji Chaiwale, a Bangalore based startup that started with a single food truck and now has six stores in the city and is expanding to 20.\\\\n\\\\nThe dynamics of a food truck are entirely different from those of a sit-down restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nAnalyzing the best location, trying new recipes, modifying plans and menus can be a lot easier in a food truck model as compared to a restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nSince sit-down restaurants are of a fixed nature, it can be difficult and expensive to change your brand name and image if needed.\\\\n\\\\nA food truck allows you to have better control and more flexibility.\\\\n\\\\nThis is seemingly the best avenue for first-time entrepreneurs since they can research, and experiment with their model before they venture into establishing a sit-down restaurant with high investments and risks.\\\\n\\\\nAfter gaining comprehensive knowledge, you can then dive into a conclusion about what would work best for your sit-down restaurant.\\\\n\\\\nThis knowledge will help you in your business expansion.\\\\n\\\\nThe incorporation of a restaurant management software would be a great idea to streamline operations for your food truck.\\\\n\\\\nThe kind of ease that a restaurant POS brings in to manage your food truck helps you to increase sales directly.\\\\n\\\\nThe future of food trucks seems to move high on the profit graph in developing India. If the revenue growth continues to grow as estimated, there are tremendous scope and growth opportunities for entrepreneurs who already are, or wish to step into the food truck business.\\\\n\\\\nHow many customers can I be getting per day?\\\\n\\\\nAfter you\\\\u2019ve determined how quickly you can serve a single customer, you can estimate how many customers you can serve in an hour, during a full shift, or a full day. For example, if it takes four minutes to prepare a meal for a customer during a rush, you\\\\u2019ll be able to serve 15 customers per hour, 45 customers per three-hour shift, or 90 customers a day if you\\\\u2019re open for two three-hour shifts.\\\\n\\\\nHow You Can Start a Food Truck Business\\\\n\\\\nThe popularity of food trucks has grown so rapidly over the past few years that some cities are now known for their food truck scene.\\\\n\\\\nWhat used to be considered a food risk has become foodie trend across the globe.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are wondering how to start a food truck business of your own and what the cost is to start a food truck, go through the following steps to quickly help you get the ball rolling.\\\\n\\\\nHow Much Does It Cost to Start a Food Truck Business?\\\\n\\\\nThe average cost to start a food truck can be anywhere between $18,000 to $114,000.\\\\n\\\\nDepending on legal fees, customization, state, and niche, a food truck owner can end up paying as little as $10,000 for their business or as much as $250,000.\\\\n\\\\nThere are several variables that can impact your cost at the end of the day.\\\\n\\\\nCosts Of Starting Up a Food Truck Business\\\\n\\\\nThese are just some initial food truck startup costs you may encounter:\\\\n\\\\n * The Truck $5,000 - $125,000\\\\n * Inspection and Initial Insurance $500 - $5,000\\\\n * Professional, Legal, and Consulting Fees $500 - $2,000\\\\n * Truck Logo and Wrap $2,500 - $5,000\\\\n * Point-of-Sale (POS) System $500 - $1,500\\\\n * Advertising and PR $500 - $5,000\\\\n * Ingredients $500 - $2,000\\\\n * Disposables $500 - $2,000\\\\nRecurring Food Truck Costs\\\\n\\\\nThere are also recurring costs to owning a food truck, including the following:\\\\n\\\\n * Fuel\\\\n * Insurance Payments\\\\n * Permits and Licenses\\\\n * Staff Payroll\\\\n * Commissary Kitchen Rent\\\\nOpening a food truck will require investment, so it is important to explore the costs involved and take the proper steps along the way to ensure its success.\\\\n\\\\nTo open a food truck, you\\\\u2019ll need to take the following steps:\\\\n\\\\n * Research Your Food Truck Scene\\\\n * Choose a Food Truck Concept\\\\n * Write a Business Plan\\\\n * Get Funding\\\\n * Get the Proper Licenses and Permits\\\\n * Buy a Food Truck\\\\n * Purchase Equipment and Supplies\\\\n * Choose a POS System\\\\n * Invest in Marketing and Advertising\\\\n1.

Your concept, name, and logo should exhibit the following attributes:\\\\n\\\\n * Be unique and memorable\\\\n * Be descriptive and attention-grabbing\\\\n * Clearly express your intentions without being too specific so that it can allow for growth\\\\nA well thought-out concept and a visually appealing logo can make a major impact on customers and whether or not they choose to shop from your truck.\\\\n\\\\n3. Write a Food Truck Business Plan\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have your concept established, it is time to get started on your food truck business plan.\\\\n\\\\nWriting a food truck business plan is an excellent way to work out the details of your business before you begin investing into it.\\\\n\\\\nThis is also the document you would present to potential investors, so it is important to lay out your vision and financial plan carefully. The sections of a food truck business plan should include the following:\\\\n\\\\n * An Executive Summary:\\\\nThis section should establish your company\\\\u2019s identity, lay out your goals, and depict what kind of food you want to sell and why.\\\\n\\\\n * A Market Analysis:\\\\nUse this section to explain which demographic your truck would cater to and who your target audience would be.\\\\n\\\\n * An Organization and Management Plan:\\\\nLay out the employee ranks and your internal structure in this section to show a clear business organizational system.\\\\n\\\\n * A Service or Product Line Description:\\\\nYou\\\\u2019ll want to provide your menu details and options for seasonal or future menu alterations.\\\\n\\\\n * Marketing and Sales Strategies:\\\\nProvide your advertising plan and different marketing tactics you plan on using to spread the word about your food truck.\\\\n\\\\n * A Funding Request:\\\\nClearly identify where the funding for your truck will come from and how much you will need to get your business started.\\\\n\\\\n * A Financial Projections:\\\\nHere you\\\\u2019ll show your investors the projected growth and financial plan for your company\\\\u2019s future in the next 5 years.\\\\n\\\\n * An Appendix:\\\\nIn this final section, you can add any additional information that did not make it into the plan, like photos, logo design, and blueprints.\\\\n\\\\nFor more information on how to write a food truck business plan, check out our business plan resource.\\\\n\\\\n4. Get Funding for Your Food Truck\\\\n\\\\nYour business plan is your first step toward requesting funding for your truck.\\\\n\\\\nConsidering the costs involved in opening a food truck, it is likely that you will need a loan to get your business off of its feet. That funding and startup savings can come from a variety of places:\\\\n\\\\n * Community sponsors\\\\n * Personal investors such as friends and family\\\\n * Crowdfunding such as Kickstarter\\\\n * Small Business Administration microloans\\\\n * Rollover of Business Startup (ROBS) from a retirement account\\\\n * Opening a business credit card\\\\n * Equipment loans and financing programs\\\\n5. Get Food Truck Licenses and Permits\\\\n\\\\nAfter you have established where your funding will be coming from, you\\\\u2019ll need to explore what licenses are needed to start a food truck.\\\\n\\\\nFood truck permits and licenses can vary from state to state and even city to city, so it is important to check with your local jurisdiction like the Chamber of Commerce, Health Department, and the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office to find out their requirements.\\\\n\\\\nTo open a food truck, you will also encounter many of the same licenses and permits required for restaurant businesses:\\\\n\\\\n * Business License\\\\n * Employer Identification Number\\\\n * Food Service License\\\\n * Employee Health Permit\\\\nAdditionally, you will most likely need the following food truck specific permits:\\\\n\\\\n * Mobile Food Facility Permit\\\\n * Zoning and Parking Permit\\\\nAs you work with your DMV to establish your parking permits and registration, be sure to ask about parking restrictions and limits in your city, along with where overnight parking is permitted.\\\\n\\\\n6.

Purchase Your Food Truck Equipment and Supplies\\\\n\\\\nFood tuck owners working on food truck equipment\\\\n\\\\nWith a truck in your possession, the next step is to furnish your space with food truck equipment and supplies.

Choose a POS System\\\\n\\\\nWhen you\\\\u2019re operating a food truck, chances are you will also need a mobile Point of Sale (POS) system. These systems allow you to take credit card payment directly from your truck but may require internet access.\\\\n\\\\nMany food trucks choose to take a cash-only route in order to not depend on internet access; however, customers are less likely to have cash on them, which can limit your customer base. This is leading food truck owners to select POS systems that allow them to accept both cash or credit.\\\\n\\\\nFor help selecting the right mobile POS system for your truck, feel free to explore our POS resource.\\\\n\\\\n9. Invest in Food Truck Marketing and Advertising\\\\n\\\\nBecause your food truck won\\\\u2019t have a permanent physical address, advertising and marketing for your food truck plays an essential part in its success.\\\\n\\\\nThere are various marketing tactics you can use to boost your brand awareness in the public eye.\\\\n\\\\nHere are just some food truck marketing ideas:\\\\n\\\\nMake your eye-catching logo highly visible.\\\\n\\\\nPlace it on your truck, on flyers, and online.\\\\n\\\\nDesign a bold menu board.\\\\n\\\\nYou will want to make sure that your menu board is legible, appealing, and clearly showcases your food.\\\\n\\\\nCreate a website that features\\\\u2026 Your regular locations, photos, and an \\\\u201cAbout Our Company\\\\u201d section.\\\\n\\\\nCreate social media account where customers can be notified about events, see pictures, and interact with your business.\\\\n\\\\nFind unique locations for your food truck.\\\\n\\\\nAt first you will want to explore various neighborhoods to find where your business best fits.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you have determined excellent locations, visit them regularly to establish name recognition with your customer base.\\\\n\\\\nBe featured at community events like catered parties and local food truck festivals. These events will make customers more familiar with your business.\\\\n\\\\nSell merchandise with your logo or slogan on it.\\\\n\\\\nYou can offer t-shirts, travel mugs, and stickers for customers to purchase at your truck or online.\\\\n\\\\nAdvantages and Challenges of Opening a Food Truck\\\\n\\\\nFood truck businesses certainly present a unique set of advantages and challenges that are important to consider before you move forward with your business.\\\\n\\\\nAdvantages of Opening a Food Truck\\\\n\\\\nMobility:\\\\n\\\\nWith a food truck, you\\'re able to move your establishment from place to place, ultimately expanding your customer base beyond one location and increasing your advertising potential.\\\\n\\\\nFlexibility:\\\\n\\\\nYou have the flexibility of bringing fresh food directly to events and festivals without renting equipment. Additionally, food trucks have a greater sense of flexibility when it comes to adjusting their menus and schedules.\\\\n\\\\nTax deductions:\\\\n\\\\nFood truck owners are able to deduct various expenses on their taxes that are not available to standard restaurant owners, like the truck itself and rental fees for truck storage.\\\\n\\\\nChallenges of Opening a Food Truck\\\\n\\\\nCompetition:\\\\n\\\\nWith the food truck market booming, it can be difficult to break through and generate a concept that will stand out from the masses.\\\\n\\\\nLong hours:\\\\n\\\\nA food truck can require many hours of maintenance, location scouting, cleaning, event booking, and more.\\\\n\\\\nZoning laws:\\\\n\\\\nIt can be difficult for food truck owners to stay up to date with zoning restrictions and local ordinances regarding where they can park their truck and how long they can remain at a single location.\\\\n\\\\nOpening a food truck can definitely be a challenge, but by following the steps above you are sure to get started on the right foot towards establishing a successful business.\", \"',\n",

Cooking meat makes it much easier to digest so your body can save a lot of energy in the process of digesting and put it towards something else \\\\u2014 like thinking.\\\\n\\\\nThe first evidence of cooked food dates back millions of years into pre-human evolution. [Bart Loews\\'s answer to Were there processed foods back in early 1800\\\\u2019s? [ https://www.quora.com/Were-there-processed-foods-back-in-early-1800-s/answer/Bart-Loews ]]\\\\n\\\\nThe more your process foods in particular ways the less you\\\\u2019re getting out of it what we\\\\u2019ve evolved to need. One fascinating example of this is linoleic acid. It\\\\u2019s found in corn, and is very beneficial to us. The problem is if we get a lot of it, we\\\\u2019ll develop heart conditions - which is one of the reasons why there was a spike in heart disease after McDonalds changed from tallow to vegetable oil in frying their food. [1]\\\\n\\\\nCereals are foods that have been pre-heated and reshaped and condensed to get far more density than we\\\\u2019re used to (evolution is really slow), with added sugar, and as a result, we eat more.\\\\n\\\\nCanned foods are superheated to eliminate contaminants and then have sugar and other flavorants added after the fact. All of this causes us to potentially want to eat more, and often digest it faster than whole foods.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line?\\\\n\\\\nOne aspect that processed foods could potentially be bad is that we will get more energy out of it than we\\\\u2019re expecting and many of them are designed to have us wanting more.\\\\n\\\\nOther aspects?\\\\n\\\\nSome people will indicate that bad chemicals are added to food.\\\\n\\\\nNot any time recently.\\\\n\\\\nBack in the 1900s chemists would discover various preservatives and sell them around the country to farmers. They\\\\u2019d keep milk looking and tasting good for much longer than before allowing them to get more milk to market, before the days of refrigeration.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem was, what they were adding wasn\\\\u2019t controlled and wasn\\\\u2019t tested for harm. Formaldehyde and white lead were a few things added that reacted badly for a lot of people.\\\\n\\\\nAs a result we have the FDA along with various organizations in the EU that regulate and investigate preservatives for safety.\\\\n\\\\nModern food is relatively safe, as much as anything is, from non-natural illnesses.\\\\n\\\\nProcessed food is generally safe, outside of it being very easy to digest and somewhat \\\\u201caddictive.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1.

       "   4: ': \"One only needs to read The Jungle [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle ] by Upton Sinclair (1906) to get a glimpse of how far the food industry has come since 1870. The biggest differences are not in the equipment but the handling of the food itself. The Jungle directly led to the creation of Federal Meat Inspection Act [ https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/rulemaking/federal-meat-inspection-act ] of 1906, which made adulteration and/or misbranding of meat or meat products a federal crime as well as enforcing sanitation during slaughtering and processing.Also, in 1906, Congress passed the Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 [ https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Legislation/ucm148690.htm ], also known as the Pure Food and Drug Act or the Wiley Act. It was the first significant series of consumer protection laws in that it banned interstate and foreign trafficking of adulterated or misbranded food and drugs. It also established sanitation criteria for the food and drug industries as well as labeling requirements and purity standards for pharmaceuticals. Then in 1938, Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [ https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/federalfooddrugandcosmeticactfdcact/ ]. This gave authority to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee the safety of food, drugs, and cosmetics by setting definitions and standards for all food, drugs, and cosmetics. The FD&C Act has been amended many times in order to keep legislation relevant and up to date on changes in the industry. In 2011, President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) [ https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ ]. It is widely considered the first major piece of federal legislation to address the food industry since FD&C Act of 1938. FSMA expanded the FDA\\\\u2019s authority to regulate the ways food is grown, harvested, and processed. This legislation was initiated as response to the numerous outbreaks of food born illness in the late 90s early 2000s. It also directly addresses intentional adulteration, bioterrorism, and food defense. In addition to these major pieces of legislation, the food industry has continued to adopt programs and systems that call food manufacturing facilities to even higher standards: Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) [ https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/HACCP/ ], Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) [ http://www.ispe.org/gmp-resources ], Safe Quality Food [ http://www.sqfi.com/ ], BRC Global Standards [ http://www.brcglobalstandards.com/ ], and Global Food Safety Initiative [ http://www.mygfsi.com/ ] to name a few.\", \"',\n",

       "   9: ': \"Most / all foods are processed in some way. When you clean and / or cook something you process it - sometimes just minimally so.  Processed foods as in \\\\\"ready to eat\\\\\" manufactured products are reputed to have high levels of preservatives which allow them to resist spoilage and abuse during processing, transportation and storage. Those preservatives (salt and sodium nitrite are just two) are reputed to be bad for you, especially if you must follow a restricted diet.  Other additives are presumed to be there because they just make the products \\\\\"addictive\\\\\" and have no nutritional value or other benefits for you - such as sugar. The facts, as always, are fairly different from the noise. The panic and hysteria surrounding additives is mostly nonsense. The government maintains a list of substances which are GRAS (generally recognized as safe) which can legally make up or be added to food products. Is that the Word from the Creator of the Universe that they are indeed safe? It\\'s the best that human experience and well-intentioned, hard-working people have been able to put together so far. If you want to have bullet-proof assurance that all you ingest is absolutely pure and safe, you must stop eating, drinking and breathing. There\\'s no \\\\\"industrial food complex\\\\\" that\\'s out there to poison anyone, no matter what noises are regularly produced by conspiracy freaks. Have people died eating contaminated food? Always. Most of the danger lies in handling, processing  and storage by end users, by far.

The additional value  of these labeled products - if any - generally lies in the placebo effect they have on consumers, not in true difference of quality, taste or safety.\\\\n\\\\nAnswer to your question is that in general one is better served by preparing one\\'s own food, from fresh ingredients, in clean circumstances. Preservatives are used in food products for very good reasons. They are neither evil nor dangerous when consumed in moderation, as anything else. They are not tailored for your particular personal needs nor preferences, but are used in order to provide safety and relative satisfaction to the widest possible group of consumers.

From a cooking perspective, a lot of cheap grills cook just fine.\\\\n\\\\nWhat they typically don\\\\u2019t do is last a long time. I am a big Weber advocate, but when I bought my son a housewarming present, I got a cheap grill for him. It will probably last maybe 5 years, give or take. A Weber would probably last 15\\\\u201320, give or take. You can look at the warranties of any grill and you will see the difference. You can look at the size of the grill, then check the weight. Better grills use more steel and weigh more.\\\\n\\\\nI got my son a grill with a stainless hood, and it\\\\u2019s cheap. I know the stainless steel used in cheap grills is usually a cheap grade and is thin, and it will rust. Stainless on a good grill is 304 stainless, thicker, and will last a very long time. I knowingly disregarded my own opinion and bought this grill anyway but I would usually advise if getting a cheap grill to get a porcelain enamel or powder coated lid instead of cheap stainless. But this grill had such a great sale price, I bought it anyway, and if they get 5 years out of it, it\\\\u2019s a good deal.\\\\n\\\\nIn the past I had a CharBroil and a Kenmore, and after a while, the burners started burning through and I got areas of yellow flame that were not hot. The burners were crap. The Kenmore had wheels that cracked so it was hard to move. The Kenmore never lit easily. Stuff like that.\\\\n\\\\nThen I got a Weber Genesis in the 90\\\\u2019s, and I got about 17 years out of that. I replaced the burners once, after 12 or 13 years. I replaced the grates once. I replaced the ignitor once. I replaced the thermostat once. I replaced the flame tamers once. Most of those parts were inexpensive, some were free from Weber. That was good service, and good products, and they always had the parts I needed (something that can be a problem with other manufacturers.)\\\\n\\\\nI eventually retired the Genesis and now have a Weber Spirit, which is the grill I use the most.\\\\n\\\\nI also have a Grand Turbo that I bought around 2007, and it\\\\u2019s a pretty good grill, but replacement parts for that is a big problem.

       "   3: ': \"Why would you want one? What resolution monitor are we talking about? (I assume 1080p - yuck.)\\\\n\\\\nI would MUCH rather have 1440p (2k) at 144hz than 1080p at 240 Hz. YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE THAT WILL RESULT IN A GAMING ADVANTAGE GOING FROM A CONSTANT 144 FPS to 240 FPS. Literally, the worst money spent possible for a gaming advantage IMHO.\\\\n\\\\nYou wouldnt need anything too crazy for 240 Hz, but its truly just a dumb marketing ploy you\\\\u2019re about to buy into!! Dont do it!\\\\n\\\\n-\\\\n\\\\nHere is an answer I posted to a related question about the differences in refresh rate which may be of use to you:\\\\n\\\\nMonitors for PCs, as well as TVs, have a \\\\u201crefresh rate\\\\u201d value associated with them. 144Hz or Hertz is the measurement of that refresh rate. Higher is better.\\\\n\\\\nWhat that refers to is how many times, per second the Monitor can \\\\u201crefresh\\\\u201d the data/picture shown on the screen. So a 60Hz monitor can only show 60 Frames Per Second - 60 pictures drawn to the monitor, per second, to simulate fluid movement.\\\\n\\\\nA 144Hz monitor can refresh that picture 144 times per second, usually referred to as 144 Frames Per Second or 144 FPS.\\\\n\\\\nSince it uses 144 \\\\u201cpictures\\\\u201d or frames per second, the movement you see on screen is MUCH more fluid and natural-looking. The higher the frame rate, the more the fluid motion is.\\\\n\\\\nFor games where split-second timing is hugely important, you will notice a big benefit to having a monitor with a higher refresh rate. /As they say FRAMES WIN GAMES.\\\\n\\\\nTHREE THINGS TO NOTE:\\\\n\\\\n1. There are monitors out there that go beyond 144Hz (144 FPS) but the human eye can only perceive a difference up to about 100 FPS give or take 20. I personally see 0 reasons for a monitor beyond 144Hz, but I DO see a huge advantage in going from 60Hz to 120 or 144hz.\\\\n2. You will also REQUIRE a video card capable of outputting the video signal to your monitor that\\'s powerful enough to actually UTILIZE those extra frames. I have a 4k 144hz Monitor with a water-cooled 2080ti Video Card, and with all the graphical bells and whistles on in some games, they will actually only run at 60 fps. Slightly less important, but important none-the-less is having a CPU powerful enough that it won\\\\u2019t \\\\u201cbottleneck\\\\u201d the GPU. The majority of games are more dependant on GPU power when it comes to the frame rate and the fluidity in how the game runs, but there ARE games that simply REQUIRE a beefy CPU to run well, even if you have a beefy GPU.\\\\n3. Your Frames Per Second are affected by what RESOLUTION your monitor is running at and your GPU is sending the video signal to the monitor at. 144hz at 4k requires WAY MORE POWER from a GPU than 144hz at 1080p. Make sure you understand what RESOLUTION your monitor maxes out at - 1080p (1k) - 1440p (2k) - or 3840p (4k). The most expensive gaming monitors are 4k that can also refresh at 144hz. You\\\\u2019ll need a 2080ti at the least to really make use of that kind of monitor\\\\n****BUT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WAIT FOR THE 3080ti or 3090 from Nvidia thats RELEASING IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS!!! Those cards will SLAY in 4k, making most games play at or near 144Hz in 4k.\\\\n\\\\nFor a very nice 4k Monitor id suggest the Asus ROG 27\\\\u2033 4k at 144hz. Note: Using 144hz mode on this monitor disables HDR. It maxes out at 120Hz if you want HDR enabled (which you do) for gaming, but that extra 24Hz is rarely, if even at all noticeable in anyway.\\\\n\\\\nBetter yet - if you have a nice budget and plan to get the Nvidia 3080ti or 3090, I HIGHLY SUGGEST THE 65\\\\u2033 LG C9 or CX OLED TVs! I have the C9 and plan to trade my 2080ti for a 3090 simply so I can connect 4k at 120Hz via HDMI.\\\\n\\\\nTV\\\\u2019s typically use HDMI ports, and only a few, like the C9 or CX have HDMI 2.1.\\\\n\\\\nHDMI 2.1 = 4k at 120 hz and 8k at 60hz\\\\n\\\\nHDMI 2.0 (which is what all current video cards output HDMI to) = 4k at 60Hz and 8k at 30hz\\\\n\\\\n**PC Gaming Monitors typically have both HDMI 2.0 ports AND DISPLAY PORTS. Display Port is the new standard for high end gaming monitors and allows for 4k at 144hz. The 2080ti will output 4k at 144hz via Display port, but only 60hz max via HDMI due to being HDMI 2.0.\\\\n\\\\nSo im currently stuck on my Asus Monitor for 120hz 4k gaming, but 99% of the time im playing on my 65\\\\u2033 LG C9 OLED at 4k, 60hz, but the 2080ti is able to keep pretty much 99% of all games LOCKED at 60hz in 4k, so it still works well and actually LOOKS BETTER THAN THE ASUS MONITOR!\\\\n\\\\nI couldn\\'t possibly recommend the LG C9 or CX OLED TV more as a truly epic 4k, 120hz gaming monitor! It\\\\u2019s the first TV to support Nvidia\\'s G-sync and the quality is truly GLORIOUS!\\\\n\\\\nMy basic setup with costs for comparison:\\\\n\\\\n1. 65\\\\u2033 LG C9 TV 4k 120hz OLED G-sync Compatible=- ~$2,200\\\\n2. 27\\\\u2033 Asus Rog 4k 144hz Monitor G-sync Compatible = ~$1,300\\\\n3. Gigabyte Aorus 2080ti Waterforce Extreme w/240mm Radiator AIO Watercooler = ~$1300\\\\n4. Modded Intel i7\\\\u20137700k CPU = ~$350 plus about $125 in modding tools and materials. **IHS (the lid) removed, Intels crappy thermal grease removed from the top of the CPU chip and replaced with Liquid Metal.

All 4 cores/8 threads running at 5.0 Ghz constantly at 1.36v. /(I may need to upgrade this CPU to avoid bottlenecking a 3090 or 3080ti :( )\\\\nLASTLY - I HIGHLY recommend your monitor/tv has G-sync compatibility as well, and that you buy an Nvidia based GPU, which has G-sync.

       "   4: ': \"Here\\\\u2019s a few tips and a detailed guide on how to was your car.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t use a sponge\\\\n\\\\nNo matter how careful you are, sponges can create light scratches and harm your finish. It all comes down to the shape of sponges \\\\u2013 they\\\\u2019re flat. When wiping a sponge across your car\\\\u2019s finish, you\\\\u2019re essentially moving dirt back and forth along the paint. Many of these particles are sharp and can create even more swirl marks. Please ditch the sponges!\\\\n\\\\nDo use a wash mitt\\\\n\\\\nMitts don\\\\u2019t have the same issues as sponges. Grit particles are absorbed into the mitt\\\\u2019s material when passed along the paint surface. Your chances of harming your paint is far less when using a wash mitt to clean your car.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t use all purpose cleaning soaps or dishwashing soaps\\\\n\\\\nHousehold cleaning liquids are meant to be used in the house, not on your car. Many can actually harm car finishes. Most of the household products won\\\\u2019t rinse off easily, could strip away wax, and some can even dry out your car\\\\u2019s paint.\\\\n\\\\nDo use a quality car shampoo or car washing liquid\\\\n\\\\nCar washing soap is specifically formulated to easily and safely clean car finishes. Most are concentrated. Simply mix with water and you\\\\u2019re ready to go. Some contain additives to help enhance shine and reduce water marks.\\\\n\\\\nStep-By-Step Guide:\\\\n\\\\nNow that you\\\\u2019re armed with the do\\\\u2019s and don\\\\u2019ts, plus an understanding of the two bucket method, let\\\\u2019s tackle the proper steps on how to wash a car by hand.\\\\n\\\\n1 \\\\u2013 Timing\\\\n\\\\nTry to avoid washing a car in direct sunlight. If you don\\\\u2019t have enough shade, try handling in the morning or late evening.\\\\n\\\\n2 \\\\u2013 Tool Prep\\\\n\\\\nUsing the two bucket method, fill one bucket with clean water. Fill the other with the soap mixture. Also set aside your mitt and plenty of towels.\\\\n\\\\n3 \\\\u2013 Pre-Soak (Optional)\\\\n\\\\nIf you have a foam cannon, lance, or foam gun, now is the time to pre-soak. If you\\\\u2019re unfamiliar with foam cannons, they\\\\u2019re an excellent way to safely clean your paint.\\\\n\\\\n4 \\\\u2013 Initial Rinse\\\\n\\\\nBegin rinsing off the car, from top to bottom. The goal is to loosen as much dirt and grim as possible. The more dirt rinsed initially, the less that will end up in the buckets.\\\\n\\\\n5 \\\\u2013 Washing\\\\n\\\\nDip your mitt in the soapy mixture and begin washing the roof of the car. Similar to the initial rinse, the idea is to move from top to bottom. As your mitt runs out of soap or becomes dirty, rinse it in the clean water bucket. Continue this step back and forth until the car is completely clean.\\\\n\\\\n6 \\\\u2013 Final Rinse\\\\n\\\\nCompletely rinse off all remaining soap, again from top to bottom. If you notice any dirty spots that were missing, go ahead and quickly wash with your mitt. If the entire car is clean, finish rinsing.\\\\n\\\\n7 \\\\u2013 Drying\\\\n\\\\nUse your towels and begin drying, starting with the roof and hood. Don\\\\u2019t forget to dry off side mirrors and all windows. Depending on the weather, you may need to towel off your car quickly to avoid water spots.\\\\n\\\\n8 \\\\u2013 Tires & Wheels\\\\n\\\\nYou may have noticed we left out tires and wheels in these steps. Ideally, it\\\\u2019s best to clean these separately. Dirty wheels are full of brake pad dust. It\\\\u2019s extremely abrasive and can harm a car\\\\u2019s finish. Given this, don\\\\u2019t use the same buckets for your tires and wheels, the cross-contamination can do more harm than good.\\\\n\\\\n9 \\\\u2013 Next Steps\\\\n\\\\nCongrats, your ride is clean! If your finish is in good shape, now is the time to apply a quality car wax or paint sealant. Or, if you need to remove swirl marks now is the time.\", \"',\n",

Some of the particles that need a pre-wash include bird droppings, bugs, grit, and the like, whose thoughtless removal could leave your car with permanent marks and scratches.\\\\nAn effective way to do a pre-wash is to use a pressure washer or a pipe to rinse the car from the top while ensuring all the places where dirt might be trapped is moist.\\\\n\\\\nCeramic Coating:\\\\nA ceramic coating is a kind of exterior vehicle finish. It\\\\u2019s a hand-applied fluid polymer. A ceramic coating is something that bonds at a chemical level with the original paint of a vehicle to form up a protective layer. This level of protection isn\\\\u2019t as extensive as a paint protection film. In short, a ceramic coating is just a different choice to something like a premium wax. Such coatings can be either permanent or semi-permanent, which means they don\\\\u2019t need as many applications as wax.\\\\n\\\\nProtection From Oxidation And UV Damage:\\\\nRegular sun exposure will set off oxidization in vehicle paint. This chemical reaction is why you wind up with paint that is tarnished and dull. The right ceramic coating will create a sturdy layer of protection between the vehicle and the UV rays from the sun. That can slow down the process of oxidation substantially. Ceramic Coating a car isn\\\\u2019t going to reverse any sun damage that\\\\u2019s already happened, it will prevent any more from happening\", \"',\n",

If this is a case of U.S. military personnel abusing your trust and your property, I would recommend writing a letter to the command structure at the base and provide documentation of the lease agreement the individual signed (you do have a lease, right?) along with photo documentation of the damage (you do have before and after photos, right?), along with any information that the military would use to establish identity and service (e.g., copy of driver\\\\u2019s license or military ID. You did make a copy for the tenant file, right?). I would make the case that said individual was the tenant, had signed an agreement that outlined the responsibilities of tenancy, and had not lived up to those responsibilities. The military of the U.S. take responsibility very seriously.\\\\n\\\\nOnce tenancy and written responsibilities are established, then documentation, including three estimates for repair, should be provided. Also, I would reasonably account for my time needed to resolve the issue as well as the amount of time that the rental unit cannot be occupied by a paying tenant due to the repairs necessary. I would place those amounts as two line items in a spreadsheet.\\\\n\\\\nMilitary professionals prefer, and work best, if the list is concise and easy to follow. If it were I, I would summarize in the last paragraph my appreciation for the command\\\\u2019s help in resolving the matter, as I would hate to see their sterling reputation tarnished and realize the command\\\\u2019s time is quite valuable, so any time given would be greatly appreciated.\\\\n\\\\nI would also consider whether inserting somewhere in the letter that you are in the process of securing a real estate lawyer to help protect you during the process, but that attorney will only be consulted to make sure you are doing things properly. I would also use an amount on the spreadsheet for the cost of repair to be half way between the middle estimate and the higher estimate. Doing so would establish reasonableness in expectations. I would send the letter by registered mail so I would have documentation of who received the letter, and when.\\\\n\\\\nThis probably will not be a fast process and realize that not all command structures are cooperative on such issues. I would make an ask in the letter that whoever is assigned to deal with this issue in the chain of command, give you a call once it is received, so you can establish a personal relationship with that individual. Document their name, rank, and contact information, and how they prefer to be contacted (email, text, phone call, etc.) for your file. Also, after a quick consult with my attorney on this issue, I would keep the attorney informed of where things stand. The military, from my experience, would prefer not to deal directly with your attorney, but they should be made aware that you are being advised by one. That way the military knows that if they do not deal with you appropriately, then they will probably have to deal with the lawyer. The military absolutely does not want to deal with a lawyer.\\\\n\\\\nOnce the issue is brought to an appropriate resolution, I would accord the officer that assisted you with a hand written thank you along with a small token of gratitude (a fruit basket, tickets to a movie, something), and a typed letter of commendation to the base commander expressing my gratitude of that individual and for the commander making the wonderful decision to place them in charge of your complaint. That way, if something like this should happen again, or perhaps if someone they know needs a place to rent, you will be rememebered and well regarded.\\\\n\\\\nI wish you a quick and easy resolution to your poor impression of the service as a result of this occupant.\", \"',\n",

When we draw with a dark color on a white surface, we are taking away light.

To draw on scratchboard you do not use a pencil but rather a sharp object such as an Xacto knife or similar tool. Drawing on scratchboard requires scratching through the top black layer to reveal the white layer below it. This technique is the opposite of drawing with traditional pencil and paper in the sense that you are drawing with light instead of dark. Drawing with light requires a reverse method of thinking and a totally different approach to your subject matter.\\\\n\\\\nWhen drawing with white against black, everything will look like a negative drawing because we are so programmed to draw the outlines of our subjects most of the time.

To make white liquid markers is not impossible, but its more difficult as far as I\\'m aware. White marker pens can be made but they invariably have to have a high solids content of something very white like chalk or titanium dioxide or something like that, which then remains behind once the solvent evaporates.\\\\nSo the short answer (in my humble opinion) is the colour of the board is dictated by the ease of manufacture of the colours of the respective writing implements for that board, whilst ensuring that the writing can be easily seen from the back of a classroom for example... hope that\\'s of some use!\", \"',\n",

The alkali originally used to make soaps were derived from ash, and contained a mixture of potassium and sodium, producing a soft soap.  Over the centuries it was discovered that sodium soaps were more solid, and potassium (\\\\\"pot ash\\\\\") soaps more liquid, so by producing or sourcing alkali with more of one or the other. it became possible to produce soap in the consistency desired.  For the most part, solid soap was more desirable because it could be cut into pieces.  Liquid soaps eventually became desirable for institutional use with dispensers as explained by Ms. Cretu, which became a necessity in enterprises where a large number of people needed to wash their hands (or even take showers) at once.  The famous Dr. Bronner\\'s family had been in the institutional liquid soap business before him, and he managed to turn their recipe for what had been an institutional product into a boutique item combined with an eye chart and propaganda sheet.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, \\\\\"liquid soap\\\\\" as currently used for hand washing was not popular for home use until the middle 1970s, when in the United States it got a boost in the form of a letter from the Food and Drug Administration, responding to an industry query, saying that they would not consider a \\\\\"cosmetic\\\\\" product misbranded solely by virtue of being labeled as \\\\\"soap\\\\\" when it was not made of fatty acid salt, if the ordinary customer would think of it as soap.  At that point they started marketing an array of solutions of various detergents, most of them soapless but soaplike, as \\\\\"liquid hand soap\\\\\".  There had been no technical barrier to bottling & selling products of that nature, since there\\'d already been liquid shampoo, but apparently the ability to legally call it \\\\\"soap\\\\\" encouraged its makers to promote it for use at the bathroom sink, even though most people had no dispensers installed there.

Even Bronner apparently hadn\\'t thought of supplying true liquid soap in a pump bottle for home use, relying instead on hippies pouring it from the bottle as sold, or even pre-diluting it at home in another bottle.

Sure, you can just grate some bar soap and pour hot water over it. After a few days gel will form and you\\\\u2019ll have liquid soap. But how would you like to make your own perfect shampoo, body wash and dish soap? I\\\\u2019ve figured it all out for you.\\\\n\\\\nLiquid Soap Ingredients\\\\n\\\\nLike hot and cold process soap, there is a lye component and an oil component.\\\\n\\\\nThe lye component is a bit different. Sodium hydroxide is used to make hard bar soap while potassium hydroxide is used to make liquid soap. Potassium hydroxide is harder to find and comes in flakes, not beads. The flakes are easier to work with, but are still caustic, so gloves and protective eyewear must be used. You\\\\u2019ll also need a small amount of borax. The other ingredients include, water, coconut oil, olive oil, essential oils and colors. You can source all of these ingredients organically except the potassium hydroxide.\\\\n\\\\nNote: Keep in mind that all of the potassium hydroxide is eliminated during the soap making process through a reaction called saponification. It\\\\u2019s no longer caustic at this point.\\\\n\\\\nEquipment\\\\n\\\\nLike hot process soap making [ https://www.diynatural.com/crock-pot-soap/ ], you\\\\u2019ll need a slow cooker [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B003UCG8II ], a stick blender [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B00ARQVM5O ], quart jar [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B00AA1H3VI ] (I use a wide mouth jar) and plastic stirring spoons [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B00BNAMYDW ]. Since this recipe is measured in ounces, you\\\\u2019ll also need a kitchen scale [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B004164SRA ]. Additional equipment includes a plastic potato masher [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B000LNP1MS ] and a large jar for the resting period. You may also need a thermometer [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B0000CF5MT ], and a ladle [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B008K3Z76Q ] to move your soap. You\\\\u2019ll also need additional water for diluting the soap paste and mixing with the borax for neutralizing the soap.\\\\n\\\\nRecipe for Liquid Soap\\\\n\\\\n * 16.5 ounces olive oil (find unrefined organic olive oil here [ https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/olive-oil-organic-extra-virgin/profile ])\\\\n * 7 ounces coconut oil (find unrefined organic coconut oil here [ https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/products/coconut-oil-unrefined/profile ])\\\\n * 5.5 ounces potassium hydroxide (find it here [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/amazon.php?asin=B001EDK0WK ])\\\\n * 16.5 ounces distilled or filtered water (find the best water filtration systems here [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/big-berkey-homepage/ ])\\\\n * 40 ounces distilled or filtered water\\\\n * 3 ounces borax (find it here [ https://www.mountainroseherbs.com/catalog/miscellaneous#product-190 ])\\\\n * 6 ounces distilled or filtered water\\\\n * essential oils, optional (find 100% pure essential oils here [ https://www.diynatural.com/go/mrh-essential-oils/ ])\\\\n * color, optional (see this article [ https://www.diynatural.com/natural-soap-colorants/ ] for ideas)\\\\nThe Process\\\\n\\\\n1. Weigh your olive oil and coconut oil and place them into the slow cooker. Turn on low.\\\\n2. In the quart jar, weigh your water. Slowly add the weighed potassium hydroxide, stirring gently as it\\\\u2019s added. Don\\\\u2019t be surprised at any sounds or reactions you may hear. (Potassium hydroxide reacts slightly differently than sodium hydroxide in water.)\\\\n3. When the potassium hydroxide is all mixed in and the solution appears clear, add your water/potassium hydroxide mixture to the oils. Don\\\\u2019t worry about the temperature.\\\\n4. Carefully stir by hand for 5 minutes to be sure all the oils come into contact with all of the potassium hydroxide.\\\\n5. After 5 minutes, begin stirring with the stick blender. It could take up to 30 minutes to achieve \\\\u201ctrace.\\\\u201d (In soap making, trace is normally when the mixture is thick like vanilla pudding, but with potassium hydroxide trace might look more like applesauce.)\\\\n6. The mixture might look like it\\\\u2019s going to separate, but don\\\\u2019t stop until you have trace.\\\\n7. Cook in the slow cooker for about 30 minutes with the lid on. Check after 30 minutes. If it\\\\u2019s separated, stir it back in.\\\\n8. Check every 30 minutes for 3-4 hours.\\\\nStages to look for\\\\n\\\\nDuring the 3-4 hour cooking stage, your soap mixture will go through several stages. They\\\\u2019ll look like this:\\\\n\\\\n * Trace \\\\u2013 thick pudding to applesauce\\\\n * Custard-like with small bubbles\\\\n * Watery mashed potatoes\\\\n * Taffy\\\\n * Chunky to creamy petroleum jelly\\\\n * Translucent petroleum jelly\\\\nEach stage could take 30 minutes or longer. Be patient! When I did this the first time, I thought it would never work and just when I was going to give up, it finally came together. You\\\\u2019ll be able to stir it at every stage except for the taffy stage. You may need the potato masher for this. It will be difficult, but keep going!\\\\n\\\\nTesting the soap & last stages\\\\n\\\\nWhen you get to the last stage and it looks translucent, you can test it. Add 1 ounce of soap paste to 2 ounces of boiling water. Stir until dissolved. Let sit a few minutes. If it turns clear or is slightly cloudy, it\\\\u2019s ready. If it\\\\u2019s really cloudy or milky, cook your soap another 30 minutes or so. Test again. If it\\\\u2019s still cloudy, you may still need to cook it or you could have mis-measured. If that happens, keep going, but use it for laundry detergent.\\\\n\\\\nIf it\\\\u2019s clear when tested, then you can go to the next step. Bring the 40 ounces of distilled or filtered water to a boil in a large pot with a lid. Add all of the soap paste and stir. You may need the potato masher here as well. When it\\\\u2019s all incorporated, turn off the heat, put the lid on and wait. After an hour, stir it. If it\\\\u2019s chunky or goopy, let it sit for a while longer. I do this so that I can leave it overnight. Otherwise I\\\\u2019ll be checking it every 5 minutes!\\\\n\\\\nOnce it\\\\u2019s all smooth, you can neutralize it with a mixture of borax in water. Dissolve 1 ounce of borax in 2 ounces of boiling water. It\\\\u2019s important to keep it hot. Weigh out 2 ounces of this and add it to the soap base, \\\\u00bd ounce at a time. When it\\\\u2019s all mixed in, you can then add color and whatever essential oils you wish. I usually add 2-3 ounces, but no more than 3 ounces.\\\\n\\\\nThe Rest Period\\\\n\\\\nNow you can ladle your soap into a large jar. I use a gallon size glass jar for this. Secure the lid and leave it for a week or so. This allows any solid particles to settle to the bottom. When your soap is clear, pour it into smaller bottles, label and enjoy! Just be sure not to disturb the sediment on the bottom or you\\\\u2019ll have to wait for it to settle again.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.diynatural.com/how-to-make-liquid-soap-natural/\", \"',\n",

       "   2: ': \" * Environmentally friendly. Foaming hand soap is firing on all cylinders when it comes to being easy on the environment. Because it is a diluted form of liquid hand soap, less soap is used per hand washing session. It is also thinner and less likely to clog drains, which people often use harsh chemicals and detergents to resolve. When less soap gets rinsed down the drain, less soap ends up in the environment. Another less obvious environmental benefit is the conservation of water. Industry studies have revealed that people who wash their hands with foaming hand soap use 16 percent less water to lather and rinse their hands than those who used regular liquid soap. The same studies suggest that foaming hand soap can be used to lather without wetting the hands and water need only be used to rinse the soap away, which can reduce water usage during hand washing by up to 45 percent. Foam soap doesn\\\\u2019t rely on chemicals to create lather, either. Forced air causes natural lathering, which helps foaming soap biodegrade faster than traditional liquid soap. Additionally, you can get more hand washes per package with foaming soap, reducing packaging and transportation impacts on the environment.\\\\n * Cost-effective. Wasting less soap means buying less soap. Foaming soap dispensers release less soap than regular liquid soap dispensers do, allowing users to achieve the same level of cleanliness with less soap. Less soap per hand wash makes the same amount last longer, which costs less. Manufacturers also need to make less soap per unit they sell. Consumers save by having to pay for less packaging and transportation, in addition to the benefit of having to use less product per hand wash.\\\\n * Sustainable. Foaming hand soap is environmentally friendly, but it is also sustainable in a larger context. By reducing the amount of emissions required to transport it, reducing the amount of packaging needed to distribute it, requiring less of it to be used per hand wash, and by using less water to rinse it away, foaming hand soap is a more financially and environmentally stable product. As an additional bonus, foaming soap dispensers need to be refilled less often, saving both time and money. Several studies have also linked foaming hand soap used in tandem with automatic dispensers to reduce infection in work spaces [ http://np.bmpdev.us/hand-washing-prevents-norovirus/ ] and improve the health of employees that use it.\\\\n * Measured amount for proper hygiene. Because foaming hand soap lathers more easily, less of it is required to achieve an acceptable level of hand hygiene. Consumer surveys have also consistently revealed that hand washing is easier with foaming hand soap than with liquid soap. Foaming soap maintains this advantage because it is dispensed in a ready-to-lather form. Less of it is needed to fully cover hands in lather. Less of it is wasted and washed down the drain, as well.\\\\n * Sorry for the length, hope this helps.\\\\n\", \"',\n",

One class is polymers of the type that make the head on beer -- mostly carbohydrates such as modified starches and cellulose compounds.  The other class is small-molecule surfactants, some of which have some detergency and foaming capacity on their own, others of which supply little foam or detergency on their own but will stabilize other surfactants\\' foam; many of them will also make concentrated solutions of surfactants more viscous.\\\\n\\\\nTrue soap makes its own foam stabilizer in solution: fatty acid.  This is why beyond a certain point, the more alkaline a solution of true soap is, the faster its suds break.  The fatty acid is made by the water\\'s acting as an acid relative to the soap, and excess alkali (base) reduces water\\'s acidity.\\\\n\\\\nOf the small-molecule surfactants used to stabilize foams of other surfactants, common ones are amine oxides (such as DDAO, dodecyl dimethyl amine oxide; or lauramidopropyl amine oxide, for another), alkanolamides (such as lauramide DEA, lauric diethanolamide), and betaines (such as cocamidopropyl dimethyl glycine betaine, cocamidopropyl betaine in the cosmetic makers\\' jargon).

       "   2: ': \"The previous answers fail to deal with the chemistry involved in sulphated batteries. When a lead acid battery discharges, it produces crystalline lead sulphate on both electrodes. While the crystals are small and located near conductive sites, they can easily dissolve and be recharged by applying a charging current. If, however, the battery has sat in a discharged state for a long time or the battery is never completely recharged with each cycle, the lead sulphate crystals increase in size and also become dissociated from conductive sites. They therefore become much harder to dissolve by charging and regenerating the charged active materials of the electrodes. So, sulphation is simply a hard to charge battery that takes limited conversion current. Trying to force more current into the battery will simply induce a secondary reaction\\\\u2014 the dissociation of water in the electrolyte into hydrogen and oxygen (electrolysis) drying the battery out.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, to recharge a sulphated battery requires a current that matches the ability to charge the material. The method recommended is to use a charger with a fixed voltage (e.g. 14.4\\\\u201314.8V) and let the battery remain on charge for days until the current falls to a very low level. It is somewhat hard to determine if the battery is then fully charged unless you have access to measure the electrolyte or voltage after allowing the battery to come to open circuit equilibrium.\\\\n\\\\nCharging sulphated batteries at high currents will cause little recharge but will overheat them and dry them out through electrolysis. Pulsing has little effect because the charge rate is dependent on the rate of dissolution of the lead sulphate. Sneaking up on lead sulphate to charge it is not possible.\\\\n\\\\nOf course it is possible for the battery to never recharge adequately in this scenario even if allowed to recharge for weeks. In that case, the battery may not be able to be put back in service. It depends on how much discharge you can tolerate. If you have to get a new battery and put it into the same service, be sure to recharge it fully on a periodic basis or you will get the same result.\", \"',\n",

What this gun is a siphon gun that sucks up a cleaning agent and propels it against a surface at high air pressure using air from an air compressor.\\\\n\\\\nA Gas Gun or a Siphon Gun\\\\n\\\\nThere are few types of dirt that will stand up to a siphon gun set up in this way. It will sure clean anything in the fuel lines out whether it be dirt, rust, old fuel etc. If you know exactly what is in the line you can get a solvent made specifically for the dirt or substance that is in the line. Grease solvent, gasoline, and diesel work well for most automotive dirt. Gasoline varnish gum requires a little more radical approach.\\\\n\\\\nBE EXTREMELY CAREFULL.

If the lines are rubber and flexible, coil them up and put them in a bucket of the solvent and let them sit over night. If they are metal of some sort you are condemned to plugging up on end solidly and using a funnel to pour the solvent in the other end. If possible take the fuel lines out and tip them back and forth while filling them with the solvent to make sure that they are completely full. Cap off the open end and let the lines soak for twenty four hours.\\\\n\\\\nAfter the soak is done, empty the solvent out of the lines and attach the siphon gun to one end or the other.

Mostly Used Way Is Vinegar\\\\nThe vinegar reacts with the rust to dissolve it off of the metal. To use, soak the metal in white vinegar for a few hours and then scrub the rusty paste off.\\\\n\\\\nAcid, specifically citric acid or acetic acid, is a great way to remove rust, particularly if it has formed on parts which can be easily removed and soaked. If, say, you want to remove rust from screws, remove the screws and soak them in vinegar. Take a half-litre plastic bottle, and put the screws inside. Pour in enough white vinegar that it\\'s about an inch above the screws.\\\\n\\\\nConclusion - Your screws should now be shiny and free from rust.\\\\n\\\\n2. Other Popular Way Is Try a lemon and Salt\\\\n\\\\nSprinkle salt over the rusted area so that it is thoroughly coated and then juice a lime over the top. Use as much juice as you can get, and allow the mixture to set for 2-3 hours before scrubbing off.\\\\n\\\\nRub the salt all over the rusted area and, when it\\'s thoroughly coated, squeeze the lemon or lime juice onto the salt. Squeeze out as much as you can, then leave it to work its magic for two or three hours.\\\\n\\\\nNow you need to scrub it off. You could use a scourer, or even some steel wool. But to avoid damaging the metal any further, it\\'s best to use the rind of the lemon or lime.\\\\n\\\\n3. Most Common Method Used Is Scrub Away Rust\\\\n\\\\nDepending on the type of metal surface you are trying to clean, you may want to use sandpaper, steel wool, or a wire brush to get rid of rust build-up. Abrasive surfaces can be excellent tools for cleaning rust of metal. Simply scrub or scrape the affected area until the rust begins to disappear. Brush or wipe away the loose rust periodically and continue scrubbing or scraping until all of the build-up is gone.\\\\n\\\\nThis option can be effective for surfaces that don\\'t scratch easily, but should not be used on soft metals or any item that needs to have a smooth appearance that is free from scratches.\\\\n\\\\n4. Industrial Most Used Way Commercial Rust Removal Products\\\\n\\\\nThere are a number of commercial rust removal products. While there are some natural products, most cleaning solutions designed to remove rust are made with phosphoric acid. This chemical solution reacts with rust, converting it to a water soluble compound that can be scrubbed away quickly and easily. Even though these types of cleaners can make short work of cleaning rust off metal, it\\'s important to be aware that they are quite toxic.\\\\n\\\\n5. Removing rust with Store-bought materials\\\\n\\\\nUse a chemical remover. Many different types of chemicals can be purchased to help dissolve rust. They are typically made from phosphoric or oxalic acid and can be harmful to bare skin. Always take precautions when using a chemical to dissolve the rust.Follow the directions for your rust-removal product, as application may vary between products.These chemicals often need to set for a long time and require scrubbing afterwards, so be ready for a little extra work.These products can be expensive and only work for small-scale projects, not larger rusted items.\\\\n\\\\nThis Are Most Common And Best Ways Which I Preferred.

Nobody wants to spend every day, all day cleaning and scrubbing so what I do is to ensure that I set aside an hour (or two) a day (where possible) to clean ONE ROOM (thoroughly) every day (from Monday to Friday) and LEAVE THE WEEKENDS FREE TO ENJOY YOURSELVES!\\\\n\\\\nIf you are married or living with a partner, it is fair for you to expect him/her to share the domestic burden of house cleaning particularly if you both work full-time.\\\\n\\\\nIn my home, my husband shares about two-thirds of the house cleaning PLUS doing all the mowing/gardening duties which makes life a lot easier. We ensure that on the days I am mopping hard surfaces, he is vacuuming and vice versa. Hard surfaces need to be swept, mopped and every surface of furniture dusted and polished.\\\\n\\\\nIn bathrooms and WC rooms, we use a squeeze mop bucket into which is placed a high grade DISINFECTANT to clean the floors. We also thoroughly disinfect every surface of the toilet (using a SEPARATE disposable cloth and cleaning from the top, exterior seating down and a designated toilet brush to clean the interior of the toilet). The bath, basin and shower recess should all be scrubbed with disinfectant and rinsed clean.\\\\n\\\\nThe kitchen sink is cleaned/disinfected using AJAX powder two or three times a week and I disinfect my granite benchtops (in the kitchen) after dinner each day. My kitchen bench tops are totally uncluttered which facilitates cleaning and makes the kitchen look neat and tidy. Remove as much clutter as you can from your home - it makes dusting and cleaning surfaces so much easier.\\\\n\\\\nThere is no need to clean rooms every day that are not used very much (eg secondary bedrooms, guest bedrooms or guest bathrooms). We have a downstairs guest bedroom that has its own ensuite bathroom which gets a thorough cleaning once every month and an additional cleaning before and after use when we have guests.\\\\n\\\\nGenerally, our timetable is outlined below (which you could adapt for your own home). On the days I am using the mop, he is vacuuming and vice versa. We have a large home so, usually, the whole house gets thoroughly cleaned once a week when we share the duties, as follows:\\\\n\\\\nMy duties during week:\\\\n\\\\n * Washing/laundry gets done every Monday\\\\n * Sweep, Mop, Clean, Dust & Polish (SMCDP) Master Bathroom & WC - Monday\\\\n * Clean, Vacuum, Dust & Polish (CVDP) - Master Bedroom & Walk-in-Robe - Tuesday\\\\n * SMCDP Kitchen - Wednesday\\\\n * CVDP Lounge and Dining Room - Thursday\\\\n * SMCDP Family Room (not used often) - EVERY FORTNIGHT 1st and 3rd Fridays\\\\n * SMCDP Downstairs guest/4th bedroom - ONCE PER MONTH 4th Fridays\\\\nPartner\\\\u2019s duties during week:\\\\n\\\\n * CVDP Study (2nd bedroom) - Monday\\\\n * SMCDP Laundry and back WC/Shower area - Tuesday\\\\n * Mowing lawns/gardening - Wednesday\\\\n * Partner does the ironing every Wednesday or Thursday evening\\\\n * SMCDP Upstairs, Downstairs hallways and Stairwell - Thursday\\\\n * CVDP 3rd Bedroom - ONCE PER MONTH (2nd Fridays)\\\\n * CVDP Downstairs guest bathroom - ONCE PER MONTH (3rd Fridays)\\\\nIf you have other things to do, are entertaining or going out, don\\\\u2019t sweat the small stuff, just leave the room (to be vacuumed) until the next day. However, it is essential that all toilet areas, bathrooms and the kitchen get thoroughly cleaned once a week. By cleaning one room thoroughly (once per week), it gives you a sense of accomplishment and ensures that you are keeping on top of the housework without it taking over your life.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, my husband and I do not have children in the house - all our children have grown up, left home and have children of their own. Therefore, our home does not get as messy as a house that is filled with little children. When our children were living at home and I was working full-time, I used to allow myself the luxury of employing a professional cleaner once every fortnight to do the big jobs (eg cleaning the bathrooms, kitchen/family rooms and living areas). It was worth every cent! However, now that we are both retired, we have the time to do the housecleaning ourselves until such a time as we get too old - when that time comes, we will probably have to sell our large home and downsize.

Yes, but only if you have lots of money (\\\\u2018full frame\\\\u2019 DSLRs are usually twice as expensive)\\\\n * B. No, if you have a normal budget and want to get into it with different lenses first (with more initial choice and opportunity)\\\\nAs you can guess, I\\\\u2019m an advocate of B. I started with a cropped frame APS-C DSLR camera instead of a full frame one. I\\'m really pleased I did.\\\\n\\\\nLet me explain why.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve been shooting with DSLRs and other cameras for over 10 years. I started with a cropped-frame DSLR. It was the best decision I ever made - it allowed me to buy an extra lens on the same budget. I look back on that period and count my blessings; that additional lens (a basic 50mm f1.8) opened my eyes to what cameras could do \\\\u2014 far more than if I had stuck with the decent zoom lens I bought with the camera.\\\\n\\\\nThen I bought another lens. And another. My photography kept improving. I kept getting more interested.\\\\n\\\\nOnly after three or four years did I buy a \\\\u2018full frame\\\\u2019 camera (a Canon 6D) when I knew I would really use it in a more committed way. By then, I had taken lots of good photos - the absence of the full frame camera didn\\'t stop me one bit. I needed to learn lots of basics first anyway.\\\\n\\\\nDon\\'t get me wrong \\\\u2014 I don\\'t regret eventually moving to a full frame camera, either. But its benefits for a novice, I have found, are marginal. For me, the main benefit of the FF camera is not actually the quality of the sensor or low light performance, but extra flexibility with different lenses.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, one of the lenses I ended up buying was Canon\\\\u2019a 16\\\\u201335mm \\\\u2018L\\\\u2019 lens, a beautiful, high quality piece that produces amazing photos. Its benefits can only be really seen on a full frame DSLR (a non FF camera magnifies the image by 1.6, eliminating the wide-angle perspective). But that was damn expensive (\\\\u20ac1,500 or thereabouts). I had previously had a wide-angle lens for the first non-FF camera that was decent and which helped me learn. But it was only when I knew that I\\'d really get out and use a wide-angle lens a lot that I invested in the higher-end system.\\\\n\\\\nFor other types of lenses, like telephoto, there are much fewer benefits to full frame. Ask any serious wildlife or birdwatching photographer and they\\'ll often have a non full-frame camera body (with a high end pricey lens) because of the extra magnification. They\\'re not worried about any fall off in image quality.\\\\n\\\\nThe reality is that the non full frame DSLR camera you buy today has sensors and processing power in it that was considered high end a couple of years ago. The quality is absolutely there.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, as well as Canon, I now also shoot with Fuji and Panasonic, both of which concentrate on non full frame camera bodies. The quality from both systems (including the lens selections) is excellent. There\\'s no way you\\'re missing out if you choose one of these systems.\\\\n\\\\nPeople might say that a cropped frame system could come back to bite you if you decide to migrate to full frame later on. The argument goes that you may have invested in lenses only suited to the cropped frame format.\\\\n\\\\nIn my experience, that\\'s putting the cart before the horse. If there comes a time when you really want to get to a higher level, trading in your gear for full frame equipment isn\\'t that big a deal. Overall, you\\'ll still have made the right decision in going for the more affordable equipment in the first place.\\\\n\\\\nHad I insisted on \\\\u2018full frame or nothing\\\\u2019 when I started with DSLRs, I wouldn\\'t have gotten into photography. I couldn\\'t have afforded he lenses that unlocked the doors for me.\", \"',\n",
       "   2: ': \"Most of the sound you hear from a DSLR is the \\\\u201cslapping\\\\u201d of the mirror as it moves up and down. This is necessary for any DSLR to use its optical viewfinder. Of course, it has long been possible, even in the days of mechanical film cameras, to \\\\u201clock up\\\\u201d the mirror and shoot without it. But you give up your viewfinder.\\\\n\\\\nBehind that mirror, you\\'ll find an electromechanical shutter\\\\u2026 this one is from a Canon EOS 5D Mark III. The shutter ensures proper exposure, just as it did back in the film days. It is responsible for the rest of the noise you hear when you take a shot with your DSLR.\\\\n\\\\nOf course, many of today\\'s DSLR cameras have a \\\\u201cLive View\\\\u201d mode that allows one to view like a mirrorless camera, directly through the sensor. The camera probably still uses the shutter for a still shot, but it won\\\\u201dt for video. The problem with this mode, other than treat it your DSLR like a cheap Point and Shoot camera by using the rear screen, is that it\\'s probably going to take the cue and behave like a cheap P&S, at least in terms of autofocus. That\\'s because the DSLR phase-detect AF systems are integrated into part of the mirror assembly (one reason for dim viewfinders \\\\u2014 the AF system is using part of your light). When you are in Live Mode, a secondary AF system is used. Canon has a pretty good one on some DSLRs, but most others are not very good.\\\\n\\\\nSo let\\'s just grab a mirrorless camera, and\\\\u2026 rats! It\\'s got a mechanical shutter, too. You normally don\\\\u2019t see it, because it\\\\u2019s open except when snapping a photo. And it will make a click, though not course, much less of a click than you get with the DSLR mirror + shutter slap. And in fact, you\\\\u2019ll also find an electromechanical shutter in higher-end P&S cameras. My Sony RX10 Mark IV has a mechanical leaf shutter.\\\\n\\\\nSensors and Shutters\\\\n\\\\nWhy the shutters? Clearly, if a camera can shoot video, it needs an electronic shutter, right? Sure. But what is an electronic shutter, exactly? And how do these things all interact?\\\\n\\\\n * In a DSLR, you view through the viewfinder, mirror, and lens, with the shutter closed. As you press the shutter, the sensor is enabled for image capture, the mirror flipped up, the shutter fired, and the mirror flipped back down. As soon as the shutter closes, the camera system can start to unload image data from the sensor, but that takes some time.\\\\n * In a mirrorless camera, you\\\\u2019re looking through the sensor with your viewfinder. So the camera actually has to shut the shutter, enable the sensor for capture, fire the shutter, read out the sensor, then open the shutter again to enable live viewing.\\\\n * Some mirrorless cameras have a mode called electronic first curtain. With this, the shutter is already open from viewing, the sensor is enabled for capture, and then the electromechanical shutter is closed to complete the exposure, and the sensor is read out. As in the other cases, the readout time doesn\\\\u2019t really matter, other than to affect when your next shot can take place.\\\\n * Most mirrorless cameras have a fully electronic exposure mode. Rather than enable the whole sensor for capture, the capture is pipelined. Maybe one row of pixels is enabled, and an exposure started. When that\\\\u2019s done, or just a bit before, the next row is enabled, then the first row is captured and processing starts. This process \\\\u201crolls\\\\u201d down the sensor until the whole image is processed. Each row is exposed for 1/1000th, 1/16,000th, whatever exposure you have set. But the time difference between the top and bottom row is larger than the exposure time, based on the speed of the sensor readout, rather thn the speed of the electromechanical shutter.\\\\nSo, how fast is the readout? It depends on the camera, but in most digital cameras, not fast enough to always prevent what\\\\u2019s been dubbed the rolling shutter effect. The fan shot on the left is an example of the weirdness you can get through the time difference from top to bottom of the sensor when shooting fast objects. The shot on the right is via global shuttter, which is what the electromechanical shutter can be, or can at least better approximate. And that\\\\u2019s why pros use electromechanical shutters.\\\\n\\\\nOn some newer cameras, such as the Sony A9 and RX10 Mark IV, there\\\\u2019s a sensor type called a stacked sensor, which includes a sensor chip, a data processing chip, and a bonus DRAM memory chip. When an image is shot, the on-chip DRAM can buffer it very quickly, allowing for faster, though not instant, sensor unloading. And very fast frame rates as well: the A9 can shoot 24 megapixel raw images at about 20fps, the RX10 Mark IV can shoot 20 megapixel raw images at about 24fps.\\\\n\\\\nThe End of the Click, Part 1\\\\n\\\\nNaturally, a photographer with a mirrorless camera can shoot without clicks. There may well be some of these, along with the DSLR and video cameras, at political press conferences, but you\\\\u2019re still hearing the DSLRs. They are the go-to camera of the pros these days.\\\\n\\\\nVery fast stacked sensors like Sony\\\\u2019s serve to reduce the rolling shutter effect. Sony pretty much pushed the A9 as a pro\\\\u2019s camera and suggested the electronic shutter mode ought to be default for most purposes. In most modern cameras, the electronic shutter also gets you a higher top speed, I get 1/8000 on my Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, electromechanically, but 1/16,000 in electronic shutter mode. On the Sony RX10, it\\\\u2019s 1/2000 top with the electromechanical shutter, 1/32000 electronically\\\\u2026 and yeah, the camera has a mode that automatically switches to/from electronic-only as your shutter speed goes up.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s easy to image that, at some point, these things get fast enough, or even truly on-chip global, to eliminate the mechanical shutter. But you can bet there will be an optional sound to do with that perfectly quiet shutter, as you find on P&S and phones with no physical shutter. You may want the click to confirm firing of the shutter. Models sometimes use the sound as a cue, etc.\\\\n\\\\nThe End of the Click, Part 2\\\\n\\\\nThe other thing to realize about those political press conferences is that they\\\\u2019re perfectly capable of arranging sound to avoid some or all of the shutter sounds. Better use of directional microphones, better room accoustics, a bit more distance from photographers, there are dozens of ways to do that.\\\\n\\\\nBut think on this\\\\u2026 have you ever been to a political event with practically no attendance and found the candidate suddenly unavailable? It happens. No politician or candidate wants to appear second-rate or ignored on-camera. So it\\\\u2019s quite possible that most political press conferences are set up with the express intention of getting all that camera sound on-screen. Those cameras make whatever that politico is saying that day seem all the more important.\\\\n\\\\nRead More\\\\n\\\\nWatch How DSLR Shutters Work in 10,000FPS Super Slow Motion [ https://petapixel.com/2015/01/29/exploring-dslr-shutters-work-10000-frames-per-second/ ]\", \"',\n",

I got a big, soft artist\\\\u2019s paint brush called a mop, made of animal hair, in an artists supply store, then sawed off most of the long wooden handle to make it easier to carry (link below). This brush is great, as it is inexpensive, it\\'s soft, and large enough to be efficient. Again, the purpose is to get any stuck particles that can scratch the glass.\\\\n\\\\nI use a 3/4 inch wide Loft Marseille Black Goat Mop Brush from Michael\\\\u2019s Art supply (nationwide or on line). They go for around $8. Link below.\\\\n\\\\nAbout 85% of the time, you can stop here. If busy shooting, especially outside, these two steps should be done daily.\\\\n\\\\nStep 3: ONLY if needed. Fog. Get clean lens tissue (each is used only once), then fog the lens with your breath, and clean. This is 100% water vapor, and is very gentle.\\\\n\\\\n95% of the time, you can stop here.\\\\n\\\\nStep 4: Lens Cleaner. Only if necessary: Get a new lens tissue. Place lens on hard surface, then put 1 drop (or one spritz if a spray cleaner) of lens cleaning fluid (I prefer ROR and/or Zeiss) in the center of the lens, then clean with the tissue. It may take a few times to get oils (especially) off the lens.\\\\n\\\\nROR (Residual Oil Remover) cleaning fluid is IMO the best because it is designed to remove oils, which most lens cleaning fluids work poorly on. The downside is that the chemicals in it break down with time and heat, and it has a life of a couple of years, after which it needs to be replaced. I also have good results with the Zeiss lens cleaner, but it\\\\u2019s not as good for oils. I carry both brands with me.\\\\n\\\\nI carry my blower, brush, lens tissue, ROR and Zeiss cleaners, and a few q-tips (for tight corners) in a zip-loc bag, that is then in another zip-loc bag, to keep everything clean.\\\\n\\\\nNote: Even if you don\\'t use UV/Clear filters for protection normally, you really should use them in certain situations, like really dusty places (i.e. African Safari\\\\u2019s), wet locations (Niagra Falls and the sea shore), and dangerous situations. In these situation, the constant cleaning required will eventually damage the lens coating or the lens itself, no matter how careful you are.\\\\n\\\\nBrush I use:\\\\n\\\\nhttp://www.michaels.com/artists-loft-marseille-black-goat-mop/M10358519.html#q=mop&start=1 [ http://www.michaels.com/artists-loft-marseille-black-goat-mop/M10358519.html#q%3Dmop%26start%3D1 ]\", \"',\n",

       "   5: ': \"So I\\\\u2019ve had some experience with this .. I\\\\u2019ve done a certain amount of time-slice photography over the years. Originally on film with Tim Macmillian and his Josephine rig, then with Nikon F5\\\\u2019s and more recently with Canon cameras. The MAIN issue is do you mean \\\\u201cIn Unison\\\\u201d or do you mean \\\\u201cSimultaneously\\\\u201d. I take \\\\u201cIn Unison\\\\u201d to mean \\\\u201ctogether\\\\u201d so (say 40\\\\u201380ms) a little error is acceptable. depending on the camera they have a little delay between being triggered and the shutter opening (the Canon 60D for instance is between 60\\\\u2013120ms after the shutter is triggered but before it opens) each camera tends to keep it\\\\u2019s timing so for instance it might be that one camera is 74ms and another is 96ms. Now it may be that 40ms of difference between the images is no problem (nobody is jumping or water is flowing etc and the light is constant(Ie not flash)) In this case then a really simple box is fine take a double opto isolator and wire one side to \\\\u201ccommon\\\\u201d pin on the DLSR and the other to Standby then on the other side of the optoisolator to the common pin on the dslr and the \\\\u201cshoot pin\\\\u201d. Then put (say) a 330ohm resistor on the input leg of the optoisolator and feed all the optos from each camera onto a single bus line then put 5V in the standby line (to put all the cameras into standby) then 5v into the shoot line. All the cameras will go off in Unison.\\\\n\\\\nHowever if you \\\\u201csimultaneously\\\\u201d then suddenly it\\\\u2019s alot more complicated. There are \\\\u201cManual\\\\u201d setups and \\\\u201cautomatic\\\\u201d setups. The \\\\u201cmanual\\\\u201d setup machine is a microcontroller (I\\\\u2019m pretty sure you could do this with an arduino) and it triggers the camera (with the circuit described above) and then it senses when the flash sync pulse is fired so it give an exact figure between the camera being triggered and the shutter opening (say 89ms) in some (timeslice)rigs this was just marked on the back of each camera. One rig in the 90s was a PC with three parallel port cards in it and the cameras were triggered by pulling a bit low. The program sorted the cameras into a firing order (so those with a 120ms delay were fired first and a 60ms delay were fired last). The way to test with digital camera is to connect a flashgun to the first camera and then make sure that all the cameras had a fully exposed frame (ie:- no part obscured with the shutter).\\\\n\\\\nHowever if I was doing this today then I think rather than have all the data collected into a program I would make separate camera controller for each camera. If each camera had an arduino and you program it to have two modes \\\\u201cLearn\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cTrigger\\\\u201d in learn mode it would measure the difference between fire and flash in trigger mode it would fire the camera so that the shutter opens 150ms after it has been triggered (Ie 150ms - Learn ms it triggers the camera).\", \"',\n",
       "   6: ': \"There\\\\u2019s a simple recipe to get an image equivalent to a full frame DSLR. Let\\\\u2019s call the crop factor 1.6 for an APS-C format camera. Assuming the subject and you are in the same position, and with the same lighting \\\\u2026.\\\\n\\\\n1. Use the same shutter speed to retain the same amount of image blur.\\\\n2. For the same framing and perspective, use a lens with focal length 1/1.6 as long. For example, if you were shooting with an 85mm lens on the full frame camera, you would use an 85/1.6 = 53mm or 50 mm lens for APS-C format.\\\\n3. For the same background blur, use an f-number 1/1.6 as large. For example, if you were shoot at f/4 on the 85mm lens (about right to keep both eyes in focus for someone with their nose pointed at an angle to you, then shoot a f (4/1.6) = f/2.5 on the APS-C format.\\\\n4. To keep the same image brightness you will need to lower the ISO by a factor of 1.6. So if you were shooting at ISO 200 on full-frame, then adjust your APS-C camera to ISO 200/1.6*1.6 which is approximately ISO 80.\\\\nNote that three factors have change in a coordinated manner \\\\u2026 focal length, f/number, and ISO. If you do this you will see no difference in the resulting images between the full-frame and APS-C format cameras.\\\\n\\\\nThe advantage of the full frame camera is that there are some things it can do that can\\\\u2019t be achieved in APS-C. For example, if you\\\\u2019re shooting extremely shallow depth of field, such as an 85mm lens at f/1.2, then you would need a 50mm lens at f/0.75 \\\\u2014 a lens that you can\\\\u2019t find commercially. So if that\\\\u2019s your thing, then full frame is the way to go.\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, recognize that normal portraiture is generally not all that extreme. APS-C can perform beautifully as a portrait format if you understand basic photographic principles and use appropriate lenses.\", \"',\n",
       "   7: ': \"I use this all the time. Quite frankly, the whole \\\\u201chalf press the shutter button and hold it there\\\\u201d smacks of \\\\u201ctoo cheap to add an AF button\\\\u201d, and people just got used to it. It makes no sense if you do have an actual AF button on your camera.\\\\n\\\\nThe advantages (which are nothing to do with the SLR mechanism btw, they are just as true for non-SLR cameras) are:-\\\\n\\\\n * You never need to switch between continuous and single shot AF. Just leave it in continuous. If you need the camera to stop auto-focusing - stop pressing the button..\\\\n * You never need to switch the camera or lens between manual and auto focus*. Just leave it in continuous auto. Forever. The AF won\\\\u2019t activate unless you press the actual AF button.\\\\nThis means:\\\\n\\\\n * You can fire away without the AF slowing things down when you need to.\\\\n * If you\\\\u2019re composing a scene with the focus somewhere off-centre (maybe in the foreground, you just zap the AF on that and recompose. No need to then switch to manual, potentially moving the camera in the process.\\\\n * If you then get rushed by a rare Silver Haired Desert Seagull, you can aim the camera and nail your thumb on the AF button to track it - no need to fumble about looking for the lever to set it back to AF, and then into continuous AF - it\\\\u2019s always in continuous AF :)\\\\n * Once you have focus it stays put. When you take the next shot, if the subject hasn\\\\u2019t moved back and forth, you don\\\\u2019t need to bother focusing and recomposing again. In the studio, shooting with a model who is running through poses, you acquire focus on the eye once, and then shoot away. If every time you pressed the shutter release, the damn thing focused again, you\\\\u2019d be forever back and forth having to focus again and again for every shot\\\\u2026\\\\nThere are no disadvantages that I can think of. I\\\\u2019ve never once thought \\\\u201coh having this one button do the AF and the shutter would be useful right now\\\\u201d, any more than I\\\\u2019ve thought \\\\u201cman if only we had one button that did ISO, WB, aperture and shutter speed adjustment, all depending on how hard you press it\\\\u201d.\\\\n\\\\nAF on the shutter button is just a throwback. Like holding the ALT to get multiple undo\\\\u2019s in Photoshop, or braking with your right foot in an automatic car; paper car insurance documents, and physical vehicle excise duty discs (in the UK - actual proof of insurance and/or tax is online - the documents persisted for years but were essentially useless). They\\\\u2019re just left over from a legacy process and eventually, they go away. AF on the shutter button is the prehensile tail of camera development. Ironically, it requires more buttons and levers to enable AF on the shutter release than having a dedicated button for AF: you need a button or lever to switch between manual and auto-focus, and another button/lever to switch between single and continuous. If you have a dedicated button for AF, you don\\\\u2019t need either of those.\\\\n\\\\nIf your camera does not have a button labelled \\\\u201cAF-ON\\\\u201d or similar, it is still often possible to program another button to do it. On my Nikon D5200 I have re-assigned the AE-Lock button to be the AF button (and the Fn button to be the ISO adjustment eliminating the need for menus for exposure adjustment).\\\\n\\\\n* mechanically driven AF lenses (that use the body AF motor) may need you to switch the body to manual focus to disengage the drive - if you actually want to focus manually, by turning the focus ring. If you\\\\u2019re just using AF and then, once-focused you want it to stay there, you can just leave it in continuous AF just as you would with a modern lens.\", \"',\n",

Use a high quality detergent or consider switching to a powder detergent for better cleaning results. Clean out the detergent dispenser cup and make sure it is not clogged. Make sure you stack your dishes properly too. If the dishes are not properly loaded, the spray pattern will not be able to reach all areas of the dishes resulting in poor cleaning quality. Checking your water\\\\u2019s quality is also important. Hard water will result in the soap not dissolving well and the dishes will have a film on them. Even the use of commercial products designed to remove the spots will not improve performance in this situation. The water should be about 3/4\\\\\" deep at the front edge of the tub after it has filled.\\\\n\\\\nThe heating element, located at the bottom of the dishwasher, maintains the temperature of the water. Most dish-washing soaps will not dissolve unless the water temperature is at least 140 degrees.

That light bulb is going to be a significant source of heat and the crab will die if you don\\\\u2019t keep it at a comfortable level. As to the exact correct temperature, that depends on your room temperature. If the room is hot, then you need air conditioning to keep the tank at 70F. If the room is cold then you need a heat source. I live in a very hot area and the crab isn\\\\u2019t happy unless the tank is around 68F which is odd for a tropical creature.

Lots of people feel that the touchless washes are the way to go since the automatic ones will eventually leave swirls in your paint (which is only partly true but I\\\\u2019ll get to that in a moment). The only problem with the touchless washes is the chemistry. The way they clean cars is completely different. We combine Chemistry and what we call Mechanical Action (the physical brushes). Touchless washes only use Chemistry. Since they don\\\\u2019t have the benefit of Mechanical Action, they have to use significantly harsher chemicals than we do. Over time, this will deteriorate your clear coat, stain the rims, and seemingly bleach out the hard plastic trim pieces on your car.\\\\n\\\\nThe choice between the two also has something to do with the condition of your car when you bring it in. Is it covered in mud? Maybe go with a touchless over an automatic so it doesn\\'t rub the grit into your paint (however, you\\\\u2019d be safe with a Mister automatic\\\\u2026 One of the first chemicals to go on your car is a lubricant, and our first set of brushes are made out of what we call NeoGlide, which is basically just slippery foam. It helps push the dirt off without holding it in the cloth and rubbing it into your paint). Your traditional automatic won\\\\u2019t have these things, so you are going to run into issues if you continually bring your car in covered in mud.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as the add-ons? I swear by them. And I\\\\u2019ll address them one by one (keep in mind that this only applies to Misters).\\\\n\\\\n * The undercarriage wash is more of a rinse than anything else. We couldn\\'t use a full blown pressure washer down there or we\\\\u2019d damage electronics, but it is useful for rinsing off road grime, salt, or mud out from under your car. Having cleaned the tunnel 100\\\\u2019s of times, I can tell you that that is the dirtiest section of the tunnel, just because it removes so much filth from the underside of cars that people don\\'t even know is there.\\\\n * Wheel cleaning comes in all of our packages down to the basic, so I\\\\u2019ll address what we call Wheel Polish (only available in our Platinum, which is the top package). Basically, this is a sacrificial silicone-based polymer layer that is just meant to give your rims a slightly wet look, and it also keeps a layer between your rim and brake dust (which makes it significantly easier to clean. And since every car gets the same attention, it means that you should have immaculately clean wheels every time you come through without needing to touch up certain areas).\\\\n * And finally, my favorite, our wax, the area in which my company has set the standard for the industry. Recognize this?\\\\nWe started this. And yes, this makes a massive difference. One, it\\'s going to shine longer, and two, it\\'s going to give it another sacrificial layer to protect your paint and make it easier to clean next time. On sunny days, you can look down the line of freshly washed cars and see who got wax and who didn\\'t. Its that big of a difference. Also, it makes things like bugs and road tar so much easier to clean off, since those things would be stuck to our wax and not your clear coat.\\\\n\\\\nI said I would get to the problem of swirls in your paint. Our washes mitigate this issue as much as we possibly can, but its part of the wear of the vehicle. Handwashing is worse for it than taking it to a Mister, since at home you probably don\\'t have a cleaning lubricant and NeoGlide brushes to push off the grit before you clean. The issue is the vehicles that only get the wax-less washes every time. Even if you take 3 ply toilet paper and wipe your car in the same spot 1,000\\\\u2019s of times, you\\\\u2019ll start to see marks. The only way to effectively mitigate this completely is to either keep a coat of hand wax on it or to get our wax. Either way, you have to have something between your clear coat and the grit that it encounters every day. I\\\\u2019ll give an anecdote to illustrate:\\\\n\\\\nWe have a regular customer named Mr. Jackson. He\\\\u2019s been coming 3 times a week for six years (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays). He is retired and loves to detail his truck every single time he comes in (the inside, I mean. He lets us take care of the outside). He has a black Ford F150 and gets the wash with the wax every single time he comes in. His paint is in immaculate condition. You\\\\u2019d be hard pressed to find any issues with it anywhere, even though he takes it to one of those \\\\u201chorrible automatic washes that scratch your paint\\\\u201d 3 days out of the week. That\\\\u2019s roughly in the neighborhood of 972 washes without ANY issues. I wish I had pictures of his truck to post, but I won\\'t see him till Saturday.\\\\n\\\\nAnyways, I hope my answer has given you an insight into processes and chemicals behind a car wash.

One year, I used mothers carnuba paste wax with cleaner in October. As I was taking my car through the car wash in March, I noticed that the water was still beading up. So I stayed with mother\\'s. Another thing that is very important. NEVE, EVER WASH OR WAX YOUR CAR IN THE DIRECT RAY\\'S OF THE SUN OR WHEN THE FINISH IS HOT. You may not notice it for a couple of years, but the sun will bake in streaks down the road. Now, as for a classic car, like my 2013 ford mustang gt 5.0, I ordered this baby to my specs.

I haven\\'t had to wax her in over 2 years because she never sees the harsh elements. So be careful, use a high quality product, stay out of the sun, and wash if you want to, every week. But waxing? No. About every 6 months. One more thing. I know in hard winter climates you need to get the salt off your car. But try to go to a brushless wash.

As a young lad I used to use washing-up liquid for my car cleaning duties: eventually, after many years of believingthat waxing was about pressing down hard to remove traffic film, I found out about salt. Washing-up liquid vendors (and shampoo vendors) put lots of salt in their product because it makes the liquid more viscous, which buyers think equates to better quality. When put on some solid surface, the salty detergent forms an adhesive layer: I was slowly turning my car into a rusty, one-litre, semi-gloss fly-trap.\\\\n\\\\nMy experiences suggest that any need for more than one coat of polish is actually fixing the wrong problem.

No squeak: get a clay bar kit, because you are suffering from contaminant impregnation.

The other is the heat of the direct sunlight can cause the water to evaporate quickly, leaving mineral residue on the paint which can potentially eat the paint via chemical action.\\\\n\\\\nFollow Gary\\\\u2019s advice. Wash when dirty. Avoid bright, direct sunlight while washing. Also, use automotive detergent, not laundry detergent or anything not specifically made to wash cars.

A water-based gel is added to moisturize and give viscosity. Alcohol can dry the skin so an emollient gel is desirable, but not necessary (if you add gel, make sure to use 99% alcohol so that you can maintain the 60%+ concentration). Essential oils do nothing but add a pleasant scent. Neither the gel nor oil have any effect on the virus. In fact, any oil would theoretically weaken the alcohol. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses. That means its genetic material is surrounded by an envelope made of lipid (fat). if you break down the fat, you destroy the virus. That\\\\u2019s why plain soap and water is so effective. Similarly, alcohol is a mild solvent that degreases. You want the alcohol to concentrate on the virus and not other fats, like added oils. The few drops of essential oil you add probably won\\\\u2019t affect the alcohol but why waste money and effort on something so unnecessary?\\\\n\\\\nIndeed, I just use 70% isopropyl alcohol in a pocket-sized spray bottle, with no other ingredients. I spritz it on my hands and rub. It dries quickly and leaves no residue. A bonus is that I can also spray the alcohol on surfaces, e.g. phones, elevator buttons, banisters, subway poles, etc. So not only do I save money, but I also have a multipurpose disinfectant.\\\\n\\\\nFor those who insists on a gel-like hand sanitizer but can\\\\u2019t find suitable base, e.g. aloe vera gel, just use liquid hand soap or dishwashing soap. No alcohol is then needed. Your goal is to break down the lipid envelope and those soaps certainly break down fat very effectively. In fact, dishwashing liquid is such a powerful degreaser that you can dilute it, just as you can when washing dishes. Both soaps will probably leave a residue, which you can mostly wipe off with a tissue. But leaving it on your hands won;t be too bad either until you wash it off. Repeated sloughing of your hands will probably get rid of the soap residue as well. Just rub your hands together for 30 secs like you were washing your hands to destroy the virus first. Much cheaper than store bought hand sanitizer and you probably already have liquid handsoap and dishwashing soap at home.\\\\n\\\\nSo the answer is plain 75%+ isopropyl alcohol, liquid handsoap or dishwashing liquid.\", \"',\n",

Be sure to wash them by opting for a mild laundry detergent to prevent fading. Regular-formula detergents are known to contain harmful chemical additives that can damage fibers. Wash clothes in cold water for helping protect a garment\\'s colors since warm water makes fibers more prone to releasing dye to the wash water.\\\\n\\\\n2.

       "   2: ': \"This isn\\'t possible to answer In a simple way. The design of a duct system is dependent on the layout of your registers And the CFM requirements of the room. But general, one reduces by 2\\\\u2033 each step. But that would depend on how you are feeding your outlets. You could have a 12\\\\u2033 supply duct feeding 4 registers. You could install one 12x10x7 wye with the 7 going to one register and the 10\\\\u2033 continuing downstream. Then install a 10x8x7 with the 8 feeding downstream and the 7 to another register boot. Then at the end you could feed two 6\\\\u2033 registers for smaller rooms off the 8x6x6 at the end of the run. Or one 8\\\\u2033 at the end. You have to calculate the air needs of each room. You can use these rough figures to do so. Calculate the square footage of each room, multiply by .8. And that is your CFM requirement.\\\\n\\\\nA 12\\\\u2033 main duct will provide roughly 550 CFM at the recommended 700ft per min. at .1 static pressure for a main duct and branch ducts are at 600 ft per min, each branch duct is as follows, 10\\\\u2033 325 CFM , 8\\\\u2033 225 CFM, 7\\\\u2033 185 CFM, 6\\\\u2033 125 CFM. If you want exact numbers Google a duct calculator. I\\'m using a slide calculator. In larger rooms like a living room, divide the requirement between two supply registers. Also make sure you provide more than adequate return air to insure proper air flow.\\\\n\\\\nThis process can be adapted to your needs. It is best also not to feed a single register off the end of a main duct andnever directly from the plenum. Design so as to feed two smaller ones instead. There is a build up of pressure at the end of the run and may over feed a single register. Don\\'t install any main branches off the end panel of the plenum, only the sides. This will equalize the pressure in the plenum So each duct gets its share of the air. Also make sure to install balancing dampers at each branch typically at the wye.\\\\n\\\\nThese are general numbers but certainly close enough for your needs. Many installers just shoot from the hip with no idea how to calculate these needs. They just look at a room and say \\\\u201can 8 inch should do it\\\\u201d but this comes from sheer experience of what has typically worked not knowledge of the actual science. I was always amazed at how little knowledge many had beyond how to install the hardware. I would typically ask them back \\\\\"so how many CFM is that at what velocity?\\\\u201d Most of the time I would just get a blank look and this from guys who had been in the business for years. I prefer to calculate. There are duct calculators available online for free to help you with this. It is important to remember the recommended velocities because you need enough pressure to get the recommended throw from the register without the noise. Think of it like a water hose. If you want to reach the eaves you need more velocity than just watering the grass. But again too much velocity results in high static and loud air noise. You should barely hear the air coming from the registers. So they have to be sized correctly as well. Also, .1 static pressure is another must know for residential calculations.\", \"',\n",

If it is at the top of the tube it is usually adjustable, next check the little tube that goes from the fill valve to the over flow tube, if it is dripping you need to replace the fill valve.

Next install the fill valve following the instructions for installation and adjustment, reconnect the supply tube and.turn on the water and check for leaks. My 2nd guess would be that the flush valve (flapper) may be leaking slightly. Unfortunately many of these are now toilet specific. Often Youtube will have a video showing how to replace you specific flush valve or repair it. If you are lucky and it has a standard flapper, turn off the water to the toilet, using the control valve at the wall, flush the toilet holding down the handle until as much water leaves as possible, remove and replace the flapper also, clean the surface where the flapper sits as sometimes residue can be left there that can cause the new flapper to leak, and.turn on the water allow the toilet to fill, and flush a few times. While cleaning this surface check for pitting of the surface.

The amount of water delivered per flush may be too small, due to poor adjustment or over-aggressive water conservation efforts. The bowl starts to fill, but before it reaches the level that will cause a siphon, it stops. In this case a second flush, after the tank refills, will be successful. No need to pour water. There is a screw where the float rod meets the float valve to adjust the water level that is achieved, adjust it to give yourself more water in the tank. \\\\n2. The water is delivered too slowly. My toilet does this. The water in the bowl rises to a certain level and keeps that level as water continues to pour in from the tank and out through the siphon, never reaching the level to trigger a flush. Apparently water is trickling through the siphon as fast as it comes in from the tank. The water gets exchanged, but anything that is floating is still there. Dumping in a quart of water at this stage will trigger a siphon, giving a clean flush. Surprisingly even after the failed flush has finished, dumping a quart of water without flushing gives a clean flush, where the 2 or 3 gallons from the tank failed! \\\\nThis may be due to scale build-up in the channels leading from where the tank is connected to where the water is delivered under the rim of the bowl.

If there is now water coming out of the faucet spout, clean the filter and replace or replace the filter if it is beyond cleaning.\\\\n8.

It is essential to avoid every day, harsh cleaners, and it is equally important to look into cleaning routines and products that will clean and protect marble effectively and efficiently. When the right products are used and directions followed, marble surfaces should last indefinitely.\\\\n\\\\nTop Marble Cleaning Products\\\\n\\\\nHere are a few of the top marble cleaning products, both name brand and natural, that have been proven to be beneficial when caring for marble.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Stone Care Countertop Cleaner\\\\n\\\\nThis marble and granite cleaning spray is good for daily cleaning. It dries streak-free and optimizes brightening. It can be used on both kitchen and bathroom countertops. It is completely safe for marble and natural stone.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 SCI Clean Encounters Countertop Cleaner\\\\n\\\\nSCI ( Stone Care International) countertop cleaner is a convenient spray that both cleans and degreases. It can be used on marble, granite and quartz surfaces, and is safe for all-natural stone surfaces. It is particularly useful on an everyday basis. Rinsing is not required and there is no residual film, smearing streaking or buildup, plus a nice sheen remains on the surface. It is safe for kitchen use and is easy to use, with no added buffing.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Black Diamond Marble & Tile Floor Cleaner\\\\n\\\\nBlack Diamond is a deep cleaner that is streak-free as well as safe for marble and all-natural stone products, including ceramic, porcelain and glass tiles. It is environmentally friendly as well as biodegradable. It is a concentrated product so little it needed when mixed with water. Black Diamond is also excellent for use on flooring.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Castile Soap\\\\n\\\\nCastile soap is mild and is an excellent more natural choice for cleaning marble. Organic varieties are best used as they are free of additives and fragrances. Simply use a teaspoon in a spray bottle with water. Shake it and spray it on the marble. Wipe it with a damp cloth and further buff it out with a chamois cloth once the area is dry.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2013 Rubbing Alcohol/Isopropyl 99%\\\\n\\\\nRubbing alcohol is another more natural and less expensive way to clean marble or other natural stone surfaces. Mix about 16 ounces of water and approximately 1/8 cup of rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture on the marble surface and use a white cloth to wipe the area clean. A chamois cloth can also be used to buff out the surface.\\\\n\\\\nBeneficial Tips\\\\n\\\\nDo not use cleaners such as ammonia, vinegar or bleach as these products will etch marble, which equates to discoloration, dullness, spots, streaks, and rings that will likely be left on the marble\\\\u2019s surface.\\\\n\\\\nDo not use popular everyday cleaners like Lysol, Tilex, Windex, Lime Away, CLR and almost every other household cleaner, as they are simply too harsh for use on marble and they, too, can etch and damage the surface of the marble.\\\\n\\\\nDo not use bristly pads or abrasive cleaners on marble. Either one will scratch the marble\\\\u2019s surface.\\\\n\\\\nTry to avoid general (off the shelf) cleaners that are labeled for use with marble. Many times these more generic cleaners are ineffective.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are thinking about utilizing marble in your home, or you have inherited a marble kitchen or bathroom, there are definitely positive ways to keep those surface areas in prime condition. It comes down to utilizing the right products whether they are name brand or do-it-yourself. You can spare yourself the possibility of damage by steering clear of harsh cleaning products from the grocery or home store.\\\\n\\\\nreference: https://marble-concepts.com/top-marble-cleaning-products/\", \"',\n",

It is also very important to cleanse the skin and scalp (which is skin on your head). Your skin is the largest organ of your body. Yes, that\\'s right an organ\\\\u2026just like a lung or a pancreas. Except it\\'s outside instead of inside. Your skin has pores which are tiny open windows to the inside of your body. That\\'s why you can put topical creams and ointments (chemicals natural and synthetic) and they work. They get into your system and work for you\\\\u2026.just like food, fluids and medication.

You want all of your skin and scalp to be clean. Your mother didn\\'t teach you to wash and shower to piss you off. There is a valid scientific reason that has been proven over and over again. You all love scientific reasons. There you go.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you keep your scalp clean and your skin clean, you\\'re healthier by a huge margin. Your skin is a huge protector that prevents really bad things from getting into you and making you sick. When you get a wound of any kind, the first thing you should do is to COVER it with something as clean as possible preferably sterile. Most people don\\'t carry sterile equipment with them\\\\u2026so you use the best and cleanest you can find until the skin clears up and closes up. You get to the doctor as soon as possible or bandage it up very well yourself so the SKIN heals up.\\\\n\\\\nWashing the body anywhere is about keeping your skin clean and intact to prevent bad \\\\u201cthings\\\\u201d from crossing that barrier and making you sick immediately or eventually.\\\\n\\\\nBy doing so with shampoo, it makes your hair healthy.

Is it sulfate-free? SLS free? Paraben free? These are very harmful chemicals that are found in most shampoos today.\\\\n\\\\nThe right shampoo can completely change your hair and scalp health. If you\\\\u2019re facing issues like hair fall, patchy hair, dandruff and grey hair, it\\\\u2019s time to look towards nature for solutions.\\\\n\\\\nNatural oils have been used in alternative and homeopathic medicine for centuries. They\\\\u2019re renowned for their powerful benefits for skin, hair and mental health.\\\\n\\\\nBut their actual magic lies in solving hair problems. They\\\\u2019re popular for stimulating hair growth, stopping hair loss, controlling dandruff and giving luscious, thick hair.\\\\n\\\\nSome of the most popular essential oils are Rosemary oil, Lemon oil and Tea Tree oil. These oils when mixed with carrier oils like Jojoba oil, Argan oil and Almond Oil give noticeable results in a matter of weeks.\\\\n\\\\nThese oils improve blood circulation in the scalp which strengthens hair follicles and encourages new roots, thus promoting hair growth. Air pollution from smoke, fuel exhaust and smog make the scalp dry, itchy and dirty. These oils moisturise the scalp and give the hair the nourishment it needs.\\\\n\\\\nFor people with thin and lusterless hair, it is recommended to use shampoos with natural oils to get thick, shiny and voluminous hair. I\\\\u2019ve personally dealt a lot with persistent hair fall and tried a lot of products before finding something that actually works.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some recommendations of 100% natural and chemical-free products from my personal experience-\\\\n\\\\n1. SATTHWA ARGAN OIL SHAMPOO\\\\nContains tons of natural oils like Argan oil, Jojoba oil, Avocado oil and even Botanical Keratin which help in hair growth and controlling hair loss. It is SLS, Paraben and Silicone free so you can be assured of its safety. I saw noticeable results after few weeks of use in terms of new roots and reducing patchy hair. Best part is that it\\\\u2019s suitable for all hair types!\\\\n\\\\n2. Macadamia Natural Oil Rejuvenating Shampoo\\\\n\\\\nThis shampoo infuses Macadamia Oil and Argan Oil to help in hair rejuvenation, straightening, color, curl revival and maintenance. I have a somewhat dry scalp and it worked for me. Wouldn\\\\u2019t recommend it for all hair types. Also, this shampoo is quite expensive so shop accordingly!\\\\n\\\\nFinally, thanks for reading and hope this article was helpful for you!\", \"',\n",

The fastest way is to grind or machine it smooth. Many old skillets were made smooth in this manner, as are many of the premium skillets made today. Field, butterpat, stargazer, finex and others all grind the natural texture left by the sand mold away to make it smooth, while Lodge, and other less expensive manufacturers do not.\\\\n\\\\nA well seasoned \\\\u201crough\\\\u201d skillet can be just as nonstick as a well seasoned \\\\u201csmooth\\\\u201d skillet, as the properties of the seasoning (polymerized oil) function on a molecular level. Some would argue that rough textured skillets are even MORE nonstick than smooth, and it\\\\u2019s certainly true that seasoning bonds more readily to a rough surface. Stargazer now uses a textured rather than polished surface for this very reason. You can make the iron too smooth for the seasoning to adhere properly. The benefit of a smooth skillet-in my opinion, is that it is far nicer to cook on than a rough surface. Scraping a metal spatula over a rough surface is like nails on a chalkboard.\\\\n\\\\nI use mostly Lodge skillets, though I admire the craftsmanship of many of the premium brands. The skillet I use most frequently is a 13.25 inch Lodge, and the seasoned surface is as smooth and nonstick as any you will find.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason it is smooth is due to frequent use with an mk21680. A sturdy, straight edged metal spatula will lower the high spots left by the sand mold over time in the course of normal use.\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\u2019ve earned my cooking surface, and I wouldn\\\\u2019t trade it for any premium skillet.\\\\n\\\\nThe three images below are my skillets. The first is a rough Wagner. The middle is a partially smoothed Lodge, and the one on the right is the 13.25 Lodge I use most frequently. All images taken from the same distance. You can see the difference frequent use with the right metal spatula makes.\\\\n\\\\n\", \"',\n",
       "   2: ': \"Yes, absolutely.\\\\n\\\\nThere are many preparations that benefit from the use of cast iron, most of which are \\\\\"fire and forget\\\\\" type dishes where the cookware is heated to a specific point and its ability to hold energy, aka temperature, for long times is used to finish a dish without having to add more heat. A good example here would be baked brie, a steak finisher from Sous Vide, eggs, or vegetables. Sometimes the cast iron is sent out, more often than not the dish is relocated to avoid diners burning themselves.\\\\n\\\\nWorking in a 1600 cover breakfast joint we used almost exclusively cast iron because, once seasoned and finished, the pan keeps its properties for the duration of a service. The additional work after that, cleaning, re-seasoning, and drying, is negligible compared to the time saved having to juggle teflon non-sticks throughout the hot phase.\\\\n\\\\nAnything that needs to be butter basted works best in such pans as well, not to mention French style omelets which require vigorous stirring as they set to prevent large curds from forming. I can do this reasonably safe with a teflon pan at home but in massive ops I prefer not to have to pay that much attention.\\\\n\\\\nThe best part about cast iron is that I can quickly emergency-season it by mixing salt and oil, scouring it into the hot pan, and letting it work for about five minutes on the flame. Pour, wipe, re-seasoned. This works well if some newbie cook burned the pan or left something in it and reduced it to carbon. With teflon I  lose a pan.\\\\n\\\\nA few months ago I did a tour of a ghost town in Arizona and found three cast iron cookwares that were \\\\\"imported\\\\\" by their owners from England in the early 1800s, used until 1946 when the restaurant closed, and were still usable after another 60+ years of sitting in an abandoned house.

This is why they should be \\\\u2018seasoned\\\\u2019. Seasoning cast iron properly involves coating the entire surface of the metal with fat and/or cooking oil, then heating it to open those pores wide so they draw the softened fat/oil in where it becomes hydrolyzed and polymerized over the course of several heatings. This coating protects the cast iron from rust and reduces the tendency for food to stick.\\\\n\\\\nCast iron is best cleaned using only mild soap and water. If you have scorched food sticking to your cast iron or it has been unused long enough to have begun to rust, the best option is to scrub the surface with clean damp sand or dampened salt (the coarser the better) followed by thoroughly drying it and adding a fresh coat of seasoning as described in the previous paragraph.\\\\n\\\\nIf your cast iron pan will be unused for more than a few days it should be wiped thorough inside and out with a light coating of lard or oil, heated until it begins to smoke a little, then allowed to cool before being stored.

Cleanout plugs in cast iron pipes are usually cast brass or bronze so they don\\\\u2019t oxidize and seize up in a fitting if the fitting is threaded. Cleanout plugs are removable, and I have never seen on installed in a lead-oakum joint (not really removable), so you are likely dealing with a corroded threaded fitting. Products like PB Blaster and Liquid Wrench will help loosen the corrosion, they work by capillary action dissolving rust and freeing threads, but they take time. If you can soak the threads overnight, this should improve your chances of breaking the stuck plug loose. Most cleanout plugs have a raised, square knob (some have a recessed square you need a special wrench for), so adjust a wrench so it fits the plug tightly, apply pressure, and tap the edge of the fitting lightly to further loosen the corrosion. If the fitting budges and then tightens up again, back it off, rock it back and forth, and apply more penetrating oil to the threads.\\\\n\\\\nHeating the fitting will cause it to expand, and if you use this to your advantage, you may be able to loosen the fitting with heat, but you don\\\\u2019t want to start a fire, so remove any penetrating oil or flammable materials, and avoid breathing fumes produced during heating.\\\\n\\\\nKeep in mind that old cast iron pipe is very brittle, and tapping, twisting, or otherwise creating torque against the pipe can cause it to break or cause other fittings to loosen, so keep your eyes on the whole situation while you work.\", \"',\n",

He went to our storeroom, took 8 dirty HEPAs, tested them, vacuumed them, and tested them again.\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\u2019s the HEPA before, during, and after vacuuming.\\\\n\\\\nTesting Effectiveness\\\\n\\\\nCK tested effectiveness in three ways.\\\\n\\\\nParticle Capture: CK measured the percent of 0.3 micron particles captured at the outlet of the HEPA before and after washing. These 0.3 micron particles are a great benchmark because they are the hardest particle size for HEPAs to capture [ https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/what-is-pm0-3-important/ ].\\\\n\\\\nAir Flow: CK measured air speed coming out of the HEPA before and after cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nCADR: CK used the particle capture and air flow to estimate how much clean air the machine delivers (clean air delivery rate, CADR).\\\\n\\\\nVacuum Results\\\\n\\\\nOn average, vacuuming increased CADR by about 10%.

Take it from me, I run my own cleaning company - Glimmr [ https://www.glimmr.co.uk ].\\\\n\\\\nThe only reasons you would hire a company in the first place is to save you time, and energy for other pressing activities. It is not uncommon or strange to know that most people have busy work or family schedules. Taking care of the kids or your spouse might require more effort than you imagined. Also, those with thriving, fast-moving careers hardly find the time for personal relaxation, much less constant rigorous cleaning.\\\\n\\\\nSome people wonder if they cannot work harder to create the time for their own home cleaning. While this is not a bad approach you have to ask yourself is it really worth pushing your body and schedule beyond its limits. If you are doubtful about how hiring a domestic cleaner may help, here are 10 facts about life without a domestic cleaning service.\\\\n\\\\n1. YOU LOSE VALUABLE TIME\\\\n\\\\nTime is money. Time waits for no one. Time is fleeting! In fact, time is the most valuable resource in a person\\\\u2019s life and seeing as it is beyond our control, all that\\\\u2019s left is to learn how to effectively manage time. The average homeowner will need about 3 hours to complete a thorough cleaning of a regular home. For a much bigger house, you would need at least 5 hours. Taking on this task means you lose valuable time for other activities. You might fall behind on your work or home routine. You would also lose out on quality time to spend with family, friends and yourself.\\\\n\\\\n2. YOU EXPEND MORE ENERGY AND FEEL STRESSED\\\\n\\\\nCleaning is like any other rigorous activity. It requires energy alongside time. You would agree that a cleaning regime can leave you tired and unproductive for the rest of the day. Everyone would rather do without the extra stressful and energy consuming activities.\\\\n\\\\n3. YOU ARE UNDER-EQUIPPED\\\\n\\\\nNo regular homeowner can be as equipped as a cleaning company. Just as a handyman will possess all the necessary tools to fix your home issues, in the same way, a domestic cleaning company is equipped for effective cleaning. Homeowners usually have the basic supplies for an equally regular cleaning. These tools may not solve your cleaning problems or provide the results you desire.\\\\n\\\\n4. YOU WOULD COME HOME FROM WORK TO A DIRTY HOUSE ON MOST DAYS\\\\n\\\\nThere is a feeling of dread, frustration and confusion that you experience on walking into a dirty home. Why? Because this means you cannot rest your tired feet but have to muster the strength to tidy up your home. This is terrible for people with busy schedules and stressful jobs. In the end, nothing is better than walking into your clean home and going about your normal night routine.\\\\n\\\\n5. YOU ARE NOT AS SKILLED OR EXPERIENCED AS A DOMESTIC CLEANER\\\\n\\\\nShocking but true! Regardless of how efficient you believe your cleaning routine to be or how talented you are at cleaning, you cannot do better than a skilled, and experienced domestic cleaner. A domestic cleaner knows how to clean their home just as you do but what really makes the difference is the training with appropriate equipment and experience in cleaning several homes. You might not put in the same time and effort or tools to clean your home and these results in a dissatisfaction you have to tolerate.\\\\n\\\\n6. YOU WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH BICKERING AND DISAGREEMENTS ON YOUR FAMILY\\\\u2019S CLEANING ROUTINE\\\\n\\\\nLess cleaning tasks within a family equal fewer fights or marital issues. Cleaning is an investment of time and energy and this can find several ways to upset your spouse or family harmony. It creates a path to constant disagreements and dissatisfaction with each other.\\\\n\\\\n7. YOU MIGHT GIVE UP YOUR HOBBIES\\\\n\\\\nHobbies are something we do during our free time. For an already busy person engaging in your hobbies may require a lot of effort and hard work to meet up. Domestic cleaning will probably defeat your efforts and take up what little time you can create.\\\\n\\\\n8. YOU WOULD CLEAN LESS FREQUENTLY\\\\n\\\\nWithout external help, you will be forced to reduce the frequency of your home cleaning. It becomes necessary to create time for other things and this new routine is not ideal.\\\\n\\\\n9. YOU CAN HARDLY ENJOY PEACE OF MIND\\\\n\\\\nA dirty home is always a nagging thought. It makes it difficult for you to relax or fully engage in other activities. You worry about the floors left untouched and the bathrooms that are gradually building up dirt.\\\\n\\\\n10. YOU WOULD HAVE FEWER PARTIES\\\\n\\\\nHouse cleaning after a party can be a daunting task. Without the cleaning service of domestic cleaners, you may find it difficult to have those parties you desire in your home.

So one person can infect every person breathing air in those rooms.\\\\n\\\\nMost ventilation systems, even in schools, offices, and businesses, weren\\\\u2019t designed or built or maintained to bring in sufficient outdoor air into the system to significantly exchange possibly virus infected air with fresh air because of the cost of conditioning outdoor air rather than circulating and conditioning indoor air. That possibly virus infected air defeats attempts at social distancing because the virus goes wherever the air blows, everywhere that system serves. That\\\\u2019s why our CDC in the States, along with other vital recommendations, lists social distancing AND ventilation system upgrades before schools, offices, and businesses are reopened. Almost no schools, offices, or businesses have done so because of the substantial time and money involved in replacing the HVAC systems.\\\\n\\\\nEven if wearing a mask that affords a 50% reduction in virus, and someone near you is wearing a mask with a 50% reduction in transmission, and together that gives you personally a 75% reduction, that leaves 25%, which can eventually defeat your mask.

An adequately functioning HVAC system is the one which is going to continue to keep your house comfy or trendy for all a long time, which explains the reason why HVAC care is vital.\\\\n\\\\nLower Bills\\\\n\\\\nSpending less is among the principal reasons a individual should maintain their HVAC unit.

Considering the sum of money a individual spends to put in a HVAC unit, it\\'s wise they\\'d desire to continue to keep that unit working nicely provided possible.\\\\n\\\\nEfficiency\\\\n\\\\nMuch like the lifetime of this device, a well-maintained HVAC unit will probably run better. Research proves that cluttered or unmaintained components will need to work 20-percent tougher to create the exact same quantity of heating or cooling as being a well-maintained system. Less energy is being expended if it\\'s functioning, so less pressure on the aspects of the equipment. The wear and tear over the system means easy upkeep through the spring and autumn months. Care will be a lot quicker and simpler when a individual chooses the preventative measures to maintain something functioning in tiptop form.\\\\n\\\\nFewer Emergency Repairs\\\\n\\\\nMany HVAC units may possibly require emergency repairs every once in awhile. Well-maintained units are somewhat not as likely to neglect throughout the weeks of use (June through September and December through March). Keeping a unit uptodate on most of inspections and maintenance tests means less stress that the machine will crack when it\\'s required the most.\", \"',\n",

But unlike sar, sadf can write its\\\\n\\\\ndata in many different formats (CSV, XML, etc.) The default format\\\\n\\\\nis one that can easily be handled by pattern processing commands like\\\\n\\\\nawk (see option -p). The sadf command can also be used to draw graphs\\\\n\\\\nfor the various activities collected by sar and display them as SVG\\\\n\\\\n(Scalable Vector Graphics) graphics in your web browser (see option\\\\n\\\\n-g).\\\\n\\\\nThe sadf command extracts and writes to standard output records saved\\\\n\\\\nin the datafile file. This file must have been created by a version\\\\n\\\\nof sar which is compatible with that of sadf. If datafile is omitted,\\\\n\\\\nsadf uses the standard system activity daily data file. It is also\\\\n\\\\npossible to enter -1, -2 etc. as an argument to sadf to display data\\\\n\\\\nof that days ago. For example, -1 will point at the standard system\\\\n\\\\nactivity file of yesterday.\\\\n\\\\nThe standard system activity daily data file is named saDD or\\\\n\\\\nsaYYYYMMDD, where YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the\\\\n\\\\ncurrent month and DD for the current day. sadf will look for the\\\\n\\\\nmost recent of saDD and saYYYYMMDD, and use it. By default it is\\\\n\\\\nlocated in the /var/log/sa directory. Yet it is possible to specify\\\\n\\\\nan alternate location for it: If datafile is a directory (instead of\\\\n\\\\na plain file) then it will be considered as the directory where the\\\\n\\\\nstandard system activity daily data file is located.\\\\n\\\\nThe interval and count parameters are used to tell sadf to select\\\\n\\\\ncount records at interval seconds apart. If the count parameter is\\\\n\\\\nnot set, then all the records saved in the data file will be\\\\n\\\\ndisplayed.\\\\n\\\\nAll the activity flags of sar may be entered on the command line to\\\\n\\\\nindicate which activities are to be reported. Before specifying them,\\\\n\\\\nput a pair of dashes (--) on the command line in order not to confuse\\\\n\\\\nthe flags with those of sadf. Not specifying any flags selects only\\\\n\\\\nCPU activity.\\\\n\\\\nOPTIONS top\\\\n\\\\n-C Tell sadf to display comments present in file.\\\\n\\\\n-c Convert an old system activity binary datafile (version 9.1.6\\\\n\\\\nand later) to current up-to-date format. Use the following\\\\n\\\\nsyntax:\\\\n\\\\nsadf -c old_datafile %3E new_datafile\\\\n\\\\nConversion can be controlled using option -O (see below).\\\\n\\\\n-d Print the contents of the data file in a format that can\\\\n\\\\neasily be ingested by a relational database system. The output\\\\n\\\\nconsists of fields separated by a semicolon. Each record\\\\n\\\\ncontains the hostname of the host where the file was created,\\\\n\\\\nthe interval value (or -1 if not applicable), the timestamp in\\\\n\\\\na form easily acceptable by most databases, and additional\\\\n\\\\nsemicolon separated data fields as specified by sar_options\\\\n\\\\ncommand line options. Note that timestamp output can be\\\\n\\\\ncontrolled by options -T, -t and -U.\\\\n\\\\n--dev=dev_list\\\\n\\\\nSpecify the block devices for which statistics are to be\\\\n\\\\ndisplayed by sadf. dev_list is a list of comma-separated\\\\n\\\\ndevice names. Useful with option -d from sar.\\\\n\\\\n-e [ hh:mm[:ss] ]\\\\n\\\\nSet the ending time of the report. The default ending time is\\\\n\\\\n18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format.\\\\n\\\\n--fs=fs_list\\\\n\\\\nSpecify the filesystems for which statistics are to be\\\\n\\\\ndisplayed by sadf. fs_list is a list of comma-separated\\\\n\\\\nfilesystem names or mountpoints. Useful with option -F from\\\\n\\\\nsar.\\\\n\\\\n-g Print the contents of the data file in SVG (Scalable Vector\\\\n\\\\nGraphics) format. This option enables you to display some\\\\n\\\\nfancy graphs in your web browser. Use the following syntax:\\\\n\\\\nsadf -g your_datafile [ -- sar_options ] %3E output.svg\\\\n\\\\nand open the resulting SVG file in your favorite web browser.\\\\n\\\\nOutput can be controlled using option -O (see below).\\\\n\\\\n-H Display only the header of the report (when applicable). If no\\\\n\\\\nformat has been specified, then the header data (metadata) of\\\\n\\\\nthe data file are displayed.\\\\n\\\\n-h When used in conjunction with option -d, all activities will\\\\n\\\\nbe displayed horizontally on a single line.\\\\n\\\\n--iface=iface_list\\\\n\\\\nSpecify the network interfaces for which statistics are to be\\\\n\\\\ndisplayed by sadf. iface_list is a list of comma-separated\\\\n\\\\ninterface names. Useful with options -n DEV and -n EDEV from\\\\n\\\\nsar.\\\\n\\\\n-j Print the contents of the data file in JSON (JavaScript Object\\\\n\\\\nNotation) format. Timestamps can be controlled by options -T\\\\n\\\\nand -t.\\\\n\\\\n-l Export the contents of the data file to a PCP (Performance Co-\\\\n\\\\nPilot) archive. The name of the archive can be specified\\\\n\\\\nusing the keyword pcparchive= with option -O.\\\\n\\\\n-O opts[,...]\\\\n\\\\nUse the specified options to control the output of sadf.

       "   5: ': \"answered as: What is rlogin in Linux?\\\\n\\\\nThe short answer is today, the BSD [code ]rlogin[/code](1) command is a link the newer [code ]slogin[/code](1) command and its base program [code ]ssh[/code](1), that replaced the BSD [code ]rlogin[/code](1), [code ]rsh[/code](1) and rcp(1) commands for security reasons. The original [code ]rlogin[/code](1) program was developed to allow a user from one computer to remotely login into another computer ([code ]rsh[/code](1) runs a command under a remote shell and [code ]rcp[/code](1) performs a remote copy of the files from one system to another).\\\\n\\\\nThe longer answer is that [code ]rlogin[/code](1) and the rest of the BSD 4.2 r-commands [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands ] are a suite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_suite ] of computer programs [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program ] designed to enable users of one Unix [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix ] system to log in [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_in ] or issue commands [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing) ] to another Unix [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix ] computer via a TCP/IP [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP ] based computer network [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network ]. The original programs defined by the developers of the original ARPA-net, which had developed IP and TCP to replace the original network protocols, had two primary user applications, TELNET [ http://xhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet ] and FTP [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol ].\\\\n\\\\nThe required ARPA applications were well designed for portability of interface between a number of different host operating systems, i.e. a heterogenetic network, such as the ARPA-Net, but when used in a homogenetic environment, were a bit unwieldy. Previous to the release of the BSD 4.2, homogenetic networks such as those at Xerox PARC [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company) ] for the Altos and those developed by Apollo Computer [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Computer ] had tools such as Domain\\\\u2019s [code ]crp[/code](1) (Apollo did not need [code ]rcp[/code](1) as they already had a distributed file system at the launch of their system, but PARC did not and had built a program of the same name for their PUP network).\\\\n\\\\nMy friend and colleague, Sam Leffler, a member of the UCB Development team had seen these other styles of tools and noted that they were much easier to use because the designers of those tools could make assumptions about the operating system on the remote side. He set out to duplicate the functionality of this better-integrated tools. Thus, with the release of BSD 4.2 UNIX, besides the ARPA required applications, the UCB team also provided new tools as alternatives because they had already built them and had proven to be handy to use locally.\\\\n\\\\nAs UNIX spread and became the popular system for building networked-based computing environments, the BSD supplied alternative programs became de-facto standards, as the user based preferred them to the required ARPA ones. In fact, originally Sam had not been described or specified their user level protocols using the traditional RFC or IEN process; as he created them. They had just appeared/were released as FOSS and were abandoned to the world to use by the UCB development team.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, when Sam created them, like many tools that were made for the convenience of the tools builder, a number of security issues were not thought through. To quote the security section of the Wikipedia page:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n%3E Those r-commands which involve user authentication (rcp, rexec, rlogin, and rsh) share several serious security vulnerabilities:\\\\n\\\\n * All information, including passwords, is transmitted unencrypted (making it vulnerable to interception).\\\\n * The .rlogin (or .rhosts) file is easy to misuse. They are designed to allow logins without a password [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password ], but their reliance on remote usernames, hostnames, and IP addresses is exploitable. For this reason many corporate system administrators prohibit .rhosts files, and actively scrutinize their networks for offenders.\\\\n * The protocol partly relies on the remote party\\'s rlogin client to provide information honestly, including source port and source host name. A corrupt client is thus able to forge this and gain access, as the rlogin protocol has no means of authenticating [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication ] other machines\\' identities, or ensuring that the requesting client on a trusted machine is the real rlogin client.\\\\n * The common practice of mounting users\\' home directories via NFS exposes rlogin to attack by means of fake .rhosts files - this means that any of NFS\\'s [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System ] security faults automatically plague rlogin.\\\\nDue to these problems, the r-commands fell into relative disuse (with many Unix and Linux [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ] distributions no longer including them by default). Many networks that formerly relied on rlogin and telnet have replaced them with SSH [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_shell ] and its rlogin-equivalent slogin.\\\\n\", \"',\n",

More often than not, I\\\\u2019d be in huge amounts of pain by the end of the day. After a few weeks I made and appointment with my GP.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u201cDo you work with computers?\\\\u201d She asked, \\\\u201cAnd are these headaches right across your forehead, just above your eyes?\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nShe was spot on. I needed glasses. The good news was that because I worked with computers, my employer was required to provide me with free glasses. I got a voucher from them, and booked an eye test.\\\\n\\\\nThe eye test was horrible, and I hated every moment of it. I hated the bit where they puffed air into my eyes. I hated the bit where the optometrist\\\\u2019s beard kept brushing up against me, making me itch. And I hated that it took so long. After a while I said to him that I needed to stop. I\\\\u2019d been looking at the chart for so long that the letters had lost all meaning. They no longer looked like anything other than shapes. So we took a break, and went through all the paperwork. The problem was that he left the testing rig on my face, and so I still couldn\\\\u2019t see anything.\\\\n\\\\nWell, after far too long, the test was complete. It turns out that my eyes were in a terrible condition. I was short sighted in one eye, long sighted in the other, and both eyes were the wrong shape. He also discovered that I was sensitive to the flickering of fluorescent lights.\\\\n\\\\nSuddenly, everything came into focus. When I started wearing glasses it was like moving from standard definition TV to 8K. I\\\\u2019d spent over twenty years of my life not realising that my eye sight was terrible, and suddenly I could see everything! Even colours seemed more vivid. And my dismal record of falling asleep during lectures finally made sense. I would struggle to focus on the projector screen, and also be suffering from the lighting in the lecture room, so I\\\\u2019d give my eyes a rest for a few moments by closing them, just to try and clear the headache. The problem was that when you\\\\u2019re sat in a warm room with your eyes closed and someone droning on and on about the very slight differences between the bowls of medieval clay smoking pipes, or the fact that all soil is sediment, but not all sediment is soil, it becomes very hard to stay awake.\\\\n\\\\nI often wonder how my life might have been different if I\\\\u2019d realised I needed glasses sooner. Perhaps I might have done better at University. I might even have finished my degree, although most likely not. Glasses might have helped me stay awake during lectures, but I\\\\u2019m not sure what they would have done for crippling depression.\", \"',\n",
       "   3: ': \"It depends.\\\\n\\\\nGlasses correct focusing problems: if your eye focuses too early or too late (too much in front of the retina, or not focused enough before the light hits the retina: nearsighted, farsighted, and/or presbyopic), or if it has an irregularly shaped cornea that gives you two points of focus (astigmatism), or some muscle imbalances that keep the eyes from working together correctly (helped by moving the light with prism to where the eye is trying to look).\\\\n\\\\nIf poor vision is only a focusing problem, then glasses should fully correct it to crystal clear. I\\\\u2019ve had a few people weirded out by TOO clear vision sometimes! The world in HD can be a bit startling if you\\\\u2019re used to everything in soft focus.\\\\n\\\\nIf poor vision is due in part or whole to something else, though, glasses may help but they can\\\\u2019t fix everything. Cataracts, for example. Cataracts occur when the built-in lens inside your eye yellows and slowly goes opaque, typically due to age and UV exposure. You can focus light all you want, but if it\\\\u2019s physically blocked by a cataract then you\\\\u2019re not going to see clearly.\\\\n\\\\nEarly cataracts just add haze, glare, a slightly yellowish tint; they typically creep up on you slowly so you often don\\\\u2019t realize they\\\\u2019re there, but may start blaming your glasses for not quite being good enough (when they aren\\\\u2019t the problem). Final stage cataracts can block light nearly completely. This is still the leading cause of blindness in the world, though it can be corrected with surgery to remove your lens and replace it with a lens implant. Not everyone can afford or even has access to this surgery.\\\\n\\\\nAnother example is if nobody ever checks a child\\\\u2019s vision and they never get glasses, but did need them. The vision system is still developing up to around age 12. If the brain never gets good, clear visual data while it is still \\\\u201clearning to see\\\\u201d, then it may never be able to process visual data properly even if corrected later in life, because it did not get it during the correct stage of development. Sometimes glasses can still help, but such adults will often never be fully correctable.\\\\n\\\\nAn interesting experiment that researched this kind of visual development stage was kittens raised in an environment where there were no horizontal lines visible. As adult cats, they could not \\\\u201csee\\\\u201d horizontal lines, to the point of walking off tables because they could not interpret the horizontal line as an edge; the eyes could see it but the brain just couldn\\\\u2019t process it since it never got that kind of visual data during the visual formative stage.\", \"',\n",
       "   4: ': \"Q: Can I remove my spectacles if I wear 1.25D glasses in both eyes? How can I remove them?\\\\n\\\\nA: This question seems to be asked by someone every day. You can read some of my other answers which explain the research in some detail but here is a summary:\\\\n\\\\n * Legitimate research has found no consistent way to improve refractive errors other than by surgically changing the shape of the cornea, adding corrective lenses, or surgically replacing the lens in your eye.\\\\n * Legitimate research has found no significant effect from wearing glasses, not wearing them, changing diet, taking any herbs or vitamins, taking any hormones or synthetic compounds, being exposed to any radiation or lights, or lasers or sunlight, or doing any eye exercises no matter how cleverly designed. The refractive errors did not get better and they did not even slow down. You have been warned.\\\\n * The only slowing of the progression of refractive errors was observed by using diluted atropine eye drops. However, even the researchers who discovered this recommended against it due to the contraindications.\\\\n * This leaves an open question: why is myopia constantly increasing, particularly in Asia? No answer has been found yet.\\\\nIf you want to remove glasses until you reach the age of 40, consult with a good ophthalmologist. Ask how many people he rejects for LASIK surgery because they aren\\\\u2019t good candidates. Then have the surgery. There are other types of refractive surgery, also, but recovery times from LASIK are very fast.\\\\n\\\\nIf you are qualified to do research into why refractive errors are increasing, millions of people are waiting for you.\", \"',\n",

The eye got to the point where glasses were needed BEFORE the person had glasses.\\\\n\\\\nGenerally, when they stop growing, usually in the late teens to early 20s, the myopia stabilizes.
